    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a term to describe a system that parses document text into chunks, then produces numerical representations for those text chunks -- these are called embeddings. Once embeddings are created for the chunked text, RAG systems then store the embeddings in vectors in a special type of database called a vector store (e.g. the vector store is a database of embedding vectors and their associated meta data). When a user wants to sumbit a query to retrieve information from the documents or text encoded or represented by the embeddings in the vector store, a typical RAG system is designed to first measure the similarity of the user's query to the text embeddings in the vector store; the system then retrieves the embeddings most similar to the user's query; next, the system, if used with an Large Language Model (LLM), inserts the text associated with the embedding(s) most similar to the user's query into a prompt that is then sent to an LLM. The prompt sent to the LLM can be constructed in a few different ways. For example, the user's query and the text from the vector store can be sent as one 'user prompt.' Alternatively, the user's query can be sent in the 'user query' parameter of the LLM API call function and the text from the vector store can be used in the 'system prompt'; alternatively, the text (e.g. context) retrieved from the vector store can be used in the 'function' parameter in the LLM API call. Either way, the idea is that RAG with LLMs involves retrieving information/knowledge from a vector/embedding database (e.g. the vector store) and including this information, or pairing it with the user's query in the call made to an LLM."

    "## **Potential Benefits of RAG (over fine-tuning or training a LLM)**\n",
    "Research suggests RAG improves the performance of an LLM in retrieving or providing contextual information in response to user queries. Meanwhile, RAG systems do not necessarily require the same amount of computing or data resources as training a new large language model or fine-tuning an existing model. This possibly means RAG could enable businesses with less resources to build information systems with LLMs and/or allows businesses to build customized LLM applications at a lower cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Potential Limitations of RAG Systems with LLMs**\n",
    "Depending on the LLM used (e.g. open vs. closed source), RAG systems have privacy implications. For example, while the sensitive or proprietary data of a business can be securely stored in a vector store built on local or a entity's own corporate infrastructure, unless the entity also is hosting its own LLM resource(s), then calls to an external LLM API provider might expose trade secret, intellectual property, sensitive or private customer/user data. In relations, ethical considerations around data privacy, security, and intellectual property rights must be considered when deciding how to build a RAG system utlizing an LLM or other generative AI model."

    "### **Text Chunk (Document or Knowledge Base) Embeddings**\n",
    "After chunking our document(s) or the text in our knowledge base, the next step in creating a RAG system is to tranform the text chunks into embedding vectors. Essentially, embeddings are numerical representations of text. By analogy, imagine your phone number, instead of being +01 987 654 3219 was represented as Jane Smith Doe. When creating embedding vectors, we are doing the opposite. We are taking natural language or text and transforming it into a numerical representation that has some meaning in the world. In the case of a phone number, the numerical representation in the analogy is a specific person's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, embeddings that have similar numerical representations also have similar meaning or connections. For example, imagine we had scraped the website \"petfinder.com\", chunked the text of the website pages, and create embeddings for the listings on each page. Pretend there is an embedding \"123\" and an embedding \"234\" and finally and embedding \"789\". Embeddings \"123\" and \"234\" are closer in distance than \"789\". If we transformed the numbers back into text we might learn \"123\" = chihuahua and \"234\" = dachshund and \"789\" = siamese cat. Since chihuahua and dachshund are both breeds of dogs their embedding representations are less distant or more similar than the embedding for siamese cat, e.g. 789. By analogy, when we create embeddings for a knowledge base, it is typically the case that embeddings that are less distant numerically speaking are more similar with respect to their meaning or association than more distance embedding representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Query Embeddings (In this notebook, see the Section on Using LLMs in RAG Systems for more information)**\n",
    "In addition to creating embedding representations for our knowledge base or chunks of text, we also must transform our queries to the vector store or to an LLM if we choose to integrate one.\n",

       " '9 \\n \\n \\nEducational Goals \\nCarnegie Mellon is a private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \\n\"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of \\nhigher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional \\neducation and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to \\nthe community and to the nation.\" \\nMore specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all \\nstudents will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, \\nwell-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, \\nresearch and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and \\nin fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and \\nunderstanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the \\nuniversity contributes to social progress. \\nAs a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to \\ndetermine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited \\nareas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to \\nthe changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie \\nMellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially \\nfor its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, \\ngovernment and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be \\nclear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by \\nall of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated \\nregulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty \\nHandbook. \\nAcademic and Individual Freedom \\nWithin the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the \\nresponsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various \\ngroups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the \\nresponsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is \\nuniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm \\ncommitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity \\nof each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change.',\n",
       " \"10 \\n \\n \\nThe commitment to academic and individual freedom carries with it major responsibilities for all \\nmembers of the university. In exercising their own freedoms, they must respect the rights of \\nothers. In seeking innovation, they must recognize that constructive change can be affected at a \\nuniversity only through orderly and rational processes. Intentional acts threatening personal \\nsafety, malicious destruction of property or willful and substantial disruption of university \\nfunctions have no place in an academic community and will not be tolerated. It is the \\nresponsibility of all members of the academic community to maintain an atmosphere in which \\nsuch violations of rights are unlikely to occur and to develop processes which assure the \\nprotection of these rights for all persons. \\nBoard of Trustees \\nThe trustees bear ultimate responsibility for the university, its policies, organization, financing \\nand governance. Two direct responsibilities are the supervision of the university's finances \\nand the appointment of the president as chief executive officer. The operating \\nresponsibilities and the authority to act are delegated to the president; and it is primarily \\nthrough the president that the trustees monitor the university's activities. \\nAdministration \\nThe administrative officers are formally responsible for supervising the programs and \\nenforcing the policies of the university, for assessing the effects of policy and for \\nrecommending improvements or changes where appropriate. The president is the chief \\nexecutive officer of the university. In the operation of the university, the president delegates \\nresponsibility to provost, vice presidents, deans, directors and department heads and to \\nvarious councils and committees, which may include faculty, students and staff. \\nIt is the duty of the administrative officers of the university to maintain a campus climate \\nwhich enhances the freedom of the faculty to teach, to engage in research and to take part in \\nother scholarly and artistic activities, and the freedom of the students to learn and grow both \\ninside and outside of the classroom. \\nFaculty \\nThe faculty has the primary responsibility for carrying out the educational and scholarly \\nprograms of the university. \\nAll members of the faculty have the duty to conduct their courses in a manner consistent \\nwith the highest standards of their profession. Through the presentation of material in the\",\n",
       " \"11 \\n \\n \\nclassroom, they should strive to advance the art of teaching. One of the primary goals should \\nbe to instill in their students a desire to learn and an enthusiasm for the subject matter at \\nhand. The faculty as a whole also has the major responsibility for establishing and \\nmaintaining curricula which meet the standards and fulfill the educational goals of the \\nuniversity.  \\nStudents \\nCarnegie Mellon, as a private university, selects from among its applicants those students \\nwho have demonstrated the qualifications for achieving professional competence in one of \\nthe fields in which the university offers instruction. Any student who meets its standards is \\nwelcome to apply for admission and, if admitted, to remain at the university so long as he or \\nshe abides by its rules. \\nAdvisory Boards \\nEach academic department and school at Carnegie Mellon, as well as some non-academic \\nunits, has an advisory board whose purpose is to assist the department and the university \\nmore effectively to carry out their mission.  An advisory board may use any appropriate \\nmeans to achieve this purpose, important among which are evaluating the department's \\ngoals and directions and providing information and advice to the president, provost, deans \\nand department heads. \\nStatement on Academic Integrity \\nThe Statement on Academic Integrity, found in the faculty, student and staff handbooks, is the \\nfirst step in Carnegie Mellon University's ongoing effort to identify and implement the kind of \\nsociety its members wish to enjoy. \\nThis statement will be followed by implementation strategies as the Task Force on Academic \\nIntegrity continues its work.  \\nPlease visit the Academic Integrity website for additional information and resources. \\nStatement on Academic Integrity \\nCarnegie Mellon is a self-governing institution that requires ethical behavior of its \\nadministration, faculty, staff and students that goes beyond simple compliance with the law. \\nRespect for these requirements creates a moral authority for the university to insist upon\",\n",
       " \"12 \\n \\n \\nappropriate behavior. This authority is essential to the accomplishment of the university's \\nmission. Integrity as described in this statement is a defining feature of the university \\ncommunity's high expectations for the conduct of its members. \\nIntroduction \\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve \\nsociety with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and \\nexpressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the \\nchanging needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: \\nto create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, \\nteaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership \\nand problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society \\nand commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open \\nto the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. \\nThese statements provide groundwork for academic integrity that includes everyone in the \\nCarnegie Mellon community. Our common objective is to make sure that we teach and learn \\nwith commitment, consistency, honesty and fidelity. This process involves at its core \\ninteraction between young and old, novice and expert, apprentice and master. Integrity \\nrequires that we examine the context in which we do our work. In the university community, \\nyoung people grow and develop their identities, which mandate that all our dealings follow \\nand foster principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, justice and fidelity to the mission \\nof the university. The university population is increasingly diverse, faces rapid changes in \\nknowledge and technology that have historically produced uncertainty about the appropriate \\nroles of individuals and professions in the larger society. Each of these facts can and do \\ncreate issues that we need to be aware of and deal with if we are to successfully achieve our \\nprimary missions. When these circumstances are not fully communicated to and understood \\nby all persons in the community, unnecessary suspicions concerning integrity may distract \\nfrom our teaching and learning and taint the atmosphere on campus. When they are openly \\ndiscussed and conflicts concerning them openly aired, we all proceed with greater confidence \\nand trust. \\nAll members of the university community have the obligation to serve as models of personal \\nand professional integrity, as well as models for creating, expressing and transferring \\nknowledge. This implies that the faculty not only provide the knowledge and training that \\nprepare students to find their productive roles in society, but also help them discover and \\nmaintain integrity in the practice of that role. Staff and administrators are charged with \\nrepresenting the university accurately and forthrightly. Students are responsible for\",\n",
       " '13 \\n \\n \\nconducting their learning in a similarly honest and committed fashion-by avoiding plagiarism, \\ncheating or taking credit for work not their own-and thus contributing to a campus \\natmosphere which expects and supports academic integrity. \\nPractice of the Mission of Academic Integrity \\nAcademic integrity refers to the implicit commitment that every member makes to all others \\nin the community to practice those principles that underlie the mission of the university and \\ndefine academic integrity. These are: honesty and good faith; clarity in the communication of \\ncore values; professional conduct of work; mutual trust and respect; and fairness and \\nexemplary behavior. \\nHonesty and Good Faith \\nUnderlying all the interactions and transactions of the university is the assumption that all of \\nits members act in good faith and are open with each other. For example, students must be \\nable to assume that they can take faculty, staff and administration at their word and vice \\nversa. If questions about honest communications and good faith arise within the community \\nor among some of its members, the general issue must be aired in a frank and open way. \\nIndividual cases involving alleged infractions, on the other hand, are properly handled under \\nconditions that respect confidentiality. Penalties for proven infractions of the university\\'s \\nstandards must be dealt with promptly and fairly. The more fully we can come to understand \\nand concur with one another on guiding principles, the fewer such cases will turn up, and the \\nmore rewarding the university experience will be for all of us. \\nClarity in the Communication of Core Values \\nClarity in the communication of the core values and standards of Carnegie Mellon requires \\nexplicit understanding of the mission and core values among members of faculty, staff, \\nadministration and students; reflection upon and open discussion of standards of practice; \\nidentification and resolution of conflicts posed by our mission objectives; and a clear and \\nopen communication of our mission to the community. This means we recognize our \\ncommitment to the distinct objectives of our vision and mission with all the assessment, \\ncertification, evaluation and reorientation that these imply. In direct face-to-face situations \\nstudents should be dealt with immediately, openly and honestly. Students also need \\nopportunities to learn about and discuss standards, expectations and norms when no \\nimmediate \"case\" is at hand.',\n",
       " '14 \\n \\n \\nProfessional Conduct of Work \\nProfessionalism for the faculty involves designing syllabi which accurately indicate the subject \\nmatter and practices of each course and meeting all scheduled classes fully prepared for the \\nassigned work. It also involves the certification of students in their areas of expertise. The \\nuniversity is obligated to provide measures of student progress in the form of grades, \\ndegrees, and honors. These attest to society that both faculty and students have fulfilled their \\ncommitments. Degrees and honors certify that a level of performance has been met in a \\nstudent\\'s demonstration of acquisition and use of knowledge, so it is imperative that grading \\nbe a fair, accurate and honest measure of a student\\'s work. At the same time, faculty need to \\nbe cognizant of the pressure on students to view grades, which they see as determining their \\njob prospects, as \"the be all and end all\" of their university experiences and to devise \\nstrategies in the classroom to make learning, rather than receiving grades, the central focus. \\nThe ethics governing research must be understood, practiced and communicated to \\nstudents. This involves being clear and truthful about the ownership of research results and \\ndata, avoiding conflicts of interest (or disclosing them when they cannot be avoided), and \\nmaking only honest and accurate claims in reporting research. In the context of the \\nuniversity, the professional conduct of work has two distinct dimensions: professionalism in \\none\\'s discipline or area of expertise and professionalism as a member of the university. The \\ndistinction between these aspects of professionalism in the academy must be clearly \\nunderstood and communicated. In addition, each of the various academic disciplines and \\nfields of endeavor represented at Carnegie Mellon has its own implicit and explicit standards \\nfor professional work. These are binding on faculty, administration and staff, and must be \\ncommunicated to students as part of their preparation to become professionals. Research \\nethics also entails the open discussion of the propriety of the university\\'s involvement in \\nwork that seems to be detrimental to society given the values of our mission. \\nProfessional research in the academy is involved with several of its unique institutional goals, \\nincluding the education of undergraduates, graduate education and certification for \\nprofessional roles, and faculty tenure. These features pose issues specific to the academy, \\nissues which must be acknowledged and treated explicitly if we are to be clear, open and \\nconsistent. The practices of other organizations may therefore not be entirely relevant to \\nthose in the university. Recognizing that students are learners demands that they be involved \\nin ongoing research in ways which benefit their education, rather than merely as assistants in \\nfaculty projects. Students need also to be clearly informed about standards of behavior and \\nperformance that are accepted practices in the discipline and held responsible to them. This \\nshould be done proactively as a learning experience rather than retroactively as a punitive \\nexperience.',\n",
       " \"15 \\n \\n \\nMutual Trust and Respect \\nAn environment of mutual trust and respect is necessary if the institution is to promote \\nintegrity. Mutual trust and respect are prerequisites for open communication and honest \\ndialogue about values, goals and expectations. They require freedom of expression without \\nfear of retribution, institutional or otherwise, and value the diversity of persons, ideas and \\nchoices differing from one's own. They recognize that being in a diverse community is an \\nadvantage to encouraging discovery and creativity. Both respect for individuals and respect \\nfor institutional values involves balancing the claims of personal autonomy with the goals \\nand mission of the institution. All of us need to be alert to prevent the power structure of the \\nclassroom and the university as a whole from suppressing legitimate beliefs and practices. If \\ntrust should break down, we need to explore the reasons for the breakdown and identify \\nways for the community to rebuild trust among its members. \\nA basis for promoting trust and respect is provided by ensuring that the faculty treat the \\nstudent's education and the student as ends rather than as a means to some end. For \\nexample, the graduate student's development as a researcher and professional, his or her \\nlearning and well-being, have to be honored as ends in themselves, rather than treating \\ngraduate student work merely as a means to the end of the production of knowledge (from \\nwhich the professor may benefit more than the student). Students at all levels must be \\nencouraged to value their university experience as learning and personal growth, rather than \\nsolely as the means to a career goal. They are responsible for rendering an atmosphere of \\nmistrust by their teachers and among themselves unnecessary by consistently living up to \\nthe university's standards. \\nFairness and Exemplary Behavior \\nThe preservation of academic integrity means not only commitment to ideals but also justice \\nin carrying out these ideals. Faculty, staff and administration must deal fairly in all of the \\nvarious decisions they make which have consequences for students and all the other \\nstakeholders of the university. When questions arise as to whether such decisions distribute \\nbenefits and burdens fairly, significant dialogue and open communications about such \\ndecisions should be conducted. The power that teachers wield in the classroom must be \\nexercised with the greatest possible care for maintaining fairness, which means examining \\nclassroom practice for any hidden assumptions which might produce confusion or partiality. \\nIt also means that we describe to students what the expected commitment for a learning \\nenvironment is and how to deal with conflicts of commitment, for example time \\nmanagement problems, as they arise. Students must strive to be fair to each other, for \\nexample in not claiming unjustified credit in carrying out joint projects and in the appropriate\",\n",
       " '16 \\n \\n \\nsharing of facilities. Staff must demonstrate impartiality in offering students information, \\nopportunities and perquisites. \\nIntegrity in the campus community is more than just swift punishment of plagiarism or \\ncheating. It is an on-going process which asks everyone to both consider carefully and \\npractice consistently the honesty, clear thinking, professionalism, fairness and trust that \\nmake learning, teaching and living here rewarding. When misunderstandings or conflicts over \\nwhat constitutes integrity arise, as they may in a changing society, the campus must use the \\nopportunity to exercise impartiality and wisdom to adjudicate between ideas and parties. \\nRightly settled, such issues will become the basis for shared understandings in the future. \\nThe university expects its members to be leaders in matters concerning integrity, not only \\nhere, but in the larger society we serve.  \\nStandards for Academic & Creative Life (Academic Policies) \\nThis section of The Word serves to highlight many policies and procedures related to academics \\nat Carnegie Mellon University. You should also become familiar with the following sources, \\nwhich are the primary documents governing academic policies: the University Policies website, \\nthe Undergraduate Catalog, and individual department handbooks provided to each graduate \\nstudent. \\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions Overview \\nAcademic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed when any student violates the \\nUniversity Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism and unauthorized \\nassistance. \\nAcademic Integrity Policy  \\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon are engaged in intellectual activity consistent with the highest \\nstandards of the academy. The relationship between students and instructors and their \\nshared commitment to overarching standards of respect, honor and transparency determine \\nthe integrity of our community of scholars. The actions of our students, faculty and staff are a \\nrepresentation of our university community and of the professional and personal \\ncommunities that we lead. Therefore, a deep and abiding commitment to academic integrity \\nis fundamental to a Carnegie Mellon education.

Collaboration or assistance on academic work to be graded \\nis not permitted unless explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may \\nutilize the assistance provided by the Student Academic Success Center and the Academic \\nResource Center (CMU-Q) unless specifically prohibited by the course instructor(s). Any \\nother sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the course \\ninstructor(s). \\n \\nIn all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. When \\ncollaboration or assistance is permitted by the course instructor(s) or when a student \\nutilizes the services provided by the Student Academic Success Center and the Academic \\nResource Center (CMU-Q), the acknowledgement of any collaboration or assistance is \\nlikewise required. This citation and acknowledgement must be incorporated into the work \\nsubmitted and not separately or at a later point in time. Failure to do so is dishonest and \\nis subject to disciplinary action. \\n \\nInstructors have a duty to communicate their expectations including those specific to \\ncollaboration, assistance, citation and acknowledgement within each course. Students \\nlikewise have a duty to ensure that they understand and abide by the standards that \\napply in any course or academic activity. In the absence of such understanding, it is the \\nstudent’s responsibility to seek additional information and clarification. \\nPolicy Violations \\nCheating occurs when a student avails her/himself of an unfair or disallowed advantage \\nwhich includes but is not limited to: \\n1. \\nTheft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from \\nprevious course offerings. \\n2. \\nUse of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination. \\n3. \\nCopying from the examination or work of another person or source. \\n4. \\nSubmission or use of falsified data. \\n5. \\nUsing false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation.',\n",

Unique ideas or materials taken from another \\nsource for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be \\ngraded. Examples of sources expected to be referenced include but are not limited to: \\n1. \\nText, either written or spoken, quoted directly or paraphrased. \\n2. \\nGraphic elements. \\n3. \\nPassages of music, existing either as sound or as notation. \\n4. \\nMathematical proofs. \\n5. \\nScientific data. \\n6. \\nConcepts or material derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another \\nperson. \\nUnauthorized assistance refers to the use of sources of support that have not been \\nspecifically authorized in this policy statement or by the course instructor(s) in the \\ncompletion of academic work to be graded. Such sources of support may include but are \\nnot limited to advice or help provided by another individual, published or unpublished \\nwritten sources, and electronic sources. Examples of unauthorized assistance include but \\nare not limited to: \\n1. \\nCollaboration on any assignment beyond the standards authorized by this policy \\nstatement and the course instructor(s). \\n2. \\nSubmission of work completed or edited in whole or in part by another person. \\n3. \\nSupplying or communicating unauthorized information or materials, including \\ngraded work and answer keys from previous course offerings, in any way to another \\nstudent. \\n4. \\nUse of unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer \\nkeys from previous course offerings. \\n5. \\nUse of unauthorized devices. \\n6. \\nSubmission for credit of previously completed graded work in a second course \\nwithout first obtaining permission from the instructor(s) of the second course. In the \\ncase of concurrent courses, permission to submit the same work for credit in two \\ncourses must be obtained from the instructors of both courses.',\n",
       " '19 \\n \\n \\n \\nProcedures for dealing with allegations of these policy violations are detailed in the \\nuniversity’s Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures, which are published in The WORD \\nstudent handbook. Periodic review of these procedures will be overseen by the Dean of \\nStudent Affairs or her/his designee in consultation with Faculty Senate and the relevant \\nstudent governing bodies. Any amendments to these procedures are subject to the \\napproval of Faculty Senate. Additional guidelines and procedures for graduate students \\nmay exist at the college/department/program level, in which case they are communicated \\nin the college/department/program graduate student handbook. \\nAssistance for Individuals with Disabilities \\nQualified individuals are entitled to reasonable accommodations under the guidelines of the \\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Office of Disability \\nResources serves as links between students with disabilities and the campus community.  \\nAccommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis. In order to receive \\nservices/accommodations verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing \\nby a doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho-educational specialist. All information will be \\nconsidered confidential and only released to appropriate personnel on a need to know basis.  \\nTo access services, individuals must initiate a request in writing for specific \\nservices/accommodations (books on tape, enlargements, interpreters, etc.). The university \\nmakes available Summary of Accommodations memoranda for students to give to \\nprofessors, which document disability and describe the accommodations. Accommodations \\nprescribed only apply to Carnegie Mellon and may not be valid elsewhere. The individual \\ntakes full responsibility for ongoing assistance.

This policy sets forth the university’s expectations of acceptable \\nbehavior on the part of computer systems users at Carnegie Mellon by providing \\nguidelines for appropriate use of computing and related communication systems and \\nexamples of inappropriate use. These standards of acceptable behavior also extend \\nbeyond the campus community into the Internet. Just as it is unacceptable to violate \\nothers’ rights to privacy, property and resources within Carnegie Mellon, it is also \\nunacceptable to violate those rights on systems that are not at Carnegie Mellon but are \\naccessible through Carnegie Mellon’s connection to the Internet. \\nThis policy applies to all users of Carnegie Mellon computing systems, including students, \\nfaculty and staff, and any others granted the use of university computing resources. It \\napplies to the use of all computing facilities owned, leased, operated or contracted by \\nCarnegie Mellon University. As used in this policy, terms such as “computing,” \\n“computing/communications systems,” “computing resources,” etc., refer to all computers, \\ncommunication systems, and peripherals, software, telephones and systems with similar\",\n",
       " '21 \\n \\n \\nfunctions, which are owned by Carnegie Mellon, or which utilize Carnegie Mellon \\ninfrastructure such as telephone lines or computer networks. \\nAlthough this policy does not attempt to deal specifically with legal issues, university \\nmembers are responsible to act in compliance with the law, including any federal, state \\nand local laws governing computer and telecommunications use, as well as all other \\napplicable university policies. \\nPrivileges and Responsibilities \\nEvery member of the Carnegie Mellon community who uses computing and related \\ncommunications systems at Carnegie Mellon, or systems that belong to Carnegie Mellon \\nor which rely on Carnegie Mellon’s infrastructure has the responsibilities described in this \\npolicy. This includes members of the Carnegie Mellon community who have restricted \\nprivileges, such as alumni who may have electronic mail access only. Individuals with \\npersonally-owned computers, but who rely upon the university network to connect those \\ncomputers (either through an on-campus or remote network connection, such as ethernet \\nor wireless) are expected to abide by the policies set forth in this document. Personally-\\nowned computers operating in stand-alone mode or networked through a non-university \\nconnection are not covered under this policy, but those users are encouraged to consult \\nthe usage policies set forth by their Internet Service Provider. \\nA fundamental premise of this policy is that anyone sharing computing resources with \\nother individuals should behave as a reasonable, mature and ethical person. The user \\nmust recognize that computer systems and networks do not exist in a special \\nenvironment; on the contrary, use of computers is a form of communication, and every \\ncomponent of a computing environment and every piece of information it contains belong \\nto the university, the university community as a whole, or some individual or group within \\nthat community. \\nAccess to Carnegie Mellon’s computing resources is contingent upon being a member of \\nthe university community and adhering to university and Computing Services policies, \\nguidelines and procedures, including this policy. Misuse may result in the loss of access \\nand/or university disciplinary action. For some users and certain systems, access may be \\nauthorized by specific departments, research centers or other organizations affiliated with \\nCarnegie Mellon. In such cases, any department- or group-specific policies and guidelines \\nmust be adhered to when using resources provided by the department or group. This is in \\naddition to university policies and Computing Services guidelines and procedures. \\nAny user who suspects a violation of the university’s computer use policies, or who has \\nknowledge of potential vulnerabilities or security loopholes in a system or network at',\n",
       " '22 \\n \\n \\nCarnegie Mellon, should immediately notify the Information Security Office at iso-\\nir@andrew.cmu.edu. \\nMaintain the Security and Confidentiality of your Account \\nUsers assume personal responsibility for the use made of their computer accounts. This \\nresponsibility begins with selecting a secure password, and involves maintaining the \\nconfidentiality of that password and changing the password regularly in order to assure \\nthe continued security of your account. For guidance in selecting a secure password, see \\nGuidelines for Password Management. If you believe that someone has made \\nunauthorized use of your account, you should change your password immediately and \\nreport the incident to the Information Security Office. \\nRespect for Others’ Property and Privacy Rights \\nUsers are responsible to respect copyright agreements and intellectual property \\nownership. Any material that is the work of another, whether explicitly copyrighted or not, \\nshould not be distributed by any user without appropriate acknowledgement and/or \\npermission of the creator. Unless permission has been granted by the owner of copyright \\nprotected materials, distribution of copyright protected material via the university \\nnetwork or computer systems is prohibited. While the university has been granted \\npermission by software vendors to distribute certain software packages via the network, it \\nis not generally permissible for individual users to distribute that same software to others \\nvia the university network or computer systems. See the sections in this policy on Misuse \\nand Inappropriate Behavior. While there may be cases in which property rights to \\nparticular programs, data, etc., are ambiguous or in dispute, the user must assume that \\nany information not created by himself or herself belongs to someone else and must \\nrespect that person’s privacy and property rights to that information. (In certain \\nsituations, even information created by the user may not belong to that user but rather to \\nthe university or others.) This policy is not intended to limit “fair use” as permitted under \\nthe Copyright Act and users having questions about whether a particular use constitutes a \\n“fair use” may consult the Office of the General Counsel for advice. \\nImproper/Illegal Communications  \\nAny communications that would be improper or illegal on any other medium are equally \\nso on the computer: libelous material, obscene messages, harassment, forgery, threats, \\netc. However, this is not intended to restrict the free expression of ideas. Communication \\nconducted in accordance with the university policy on Freedom of Expression and with \\nthe statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment \\nand Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University will not be considered a violation of this',\n",
       " '23 \\n \\n \\npolicy. For further guidelines, see also the university policy on Separation of Individual’s \\nand Institution’s Interests. \\nResponsible Sharing of Resources  \\nWhere a resource such as memory, CPU time or access to network resources belongs to \\nthe whole community collectively, it must be shared. \\nIt is unacceptable to make such excessive use of system or network resources that other \\nusers cannot obtain access. Examples include excessive use of CPU time during a period \\nof heavy use on a timesharing system, excessive use of disk space on a system that does \\nnot limit such utilization, the use of an excessive amount of network bandwidth in an \\nenvironment of networked computers, and any activity that makes a system unusable or \\nsignificantly degrades performance for others. A novice user might be unaware that a \\nparticular action constitutes “excessive use” but, without doubt, once a system \\nadministrator makes him or her aware of the fact that such an action is unreasonable, \\nthat user will be held responsible for any further such infractions. If you are unsure \\nwhether your needs constitute excessive use, contact the system administrator. Similarly, \\nif you need an unusual amount of disk space, CPU time or other resources, check with the \\nsystem administrator to find out whether this use can be accommodated, rather than risk \\ninterfering with the work of others on the system. \\nRisks of Data Loss and Data Persistence  \\nAlthough the university will make efforts to secure the network and university controlled \\nservers from abuse and damage, it cannot guarantee against data loss by a student, \\nfaculty, member or staff, either on a university-operated or an individually-owned \\ncomputer. \\n \\nUsers should know that even those files that they have “deleted” using the appropriate \\nprocedures in the application or operating system, may indeed be recoverable if they exist \\nin a system backup file or other persistent form. If the university is asked to recover such \\ndata by subpoena, it must cooperate, and data that the user believes to have been \\ndestroyed may be recovered in the process. \\nPersonal Use  \\nWhile the university makes computer resources available primarily to achieve its goals of \\neducation and research, and for administrative activities, it realizes the need to encourage \\nthe personal use of computing for the convenience of the campus community. Thus, it is \\nreasonable to allow the use of computing resources for computer mail, document',\n",
       " '24 \\n \\n \\npreparation, personal or course Web page publication, or other activity that can facilitate \\nconvenience or enhance productivity, to the extent that the activity is within the limits \\ndescribed by Responsible Sharing of Resources. Any personal use of computing resources \\nrelated to operating a personal business or commercial enterprise is prohibited unless \\npermission to do so has been specifically granted by the provost or the provost’s \\ndesignee. \\nWe do recognize the difficulty of distinguishing whether certain cases of “personal use” \\nare allowable, such as activities that result in personal financial gain (e.g. checking stock \\nprices online), relate to a commercial business (e.g. university-sponsored technology \\ntransfer efforts), or support (but do not constitute operating) a personal business (e.g. a \\nstudent developing a business plan or a faculty member writing a report for a consulting \\nengagement outside the university). In such cases, we rely on individuals to be \\nresponsible and judicious in the use of university’s shared computing resources. In \\nparticular ensuring: \\n• appropriate use of resources (e.g. any such work is completed outside of university \\ntime and does not utilize shared resources such as CPU cycles or network bandwidth \\nto a degree that adversely impacts academic or research activities); \\n• appropriate use of licenses (e.g. do not use software procured with academic use \\nlicenses for commercial applications or development, unless the license explicitly \\npermits such use); \\n• appropriate marketing (e.g. no creation of “.com” domains within Carnegie Mellon’s \\n“edu” domain, no advertising services and products using Carnegie Mellon email \\naccounts, and no advertising using web pages on Carnegie Mellon servers (any server \\nwith a .CMU.EDU host name). \\nIn cases of questionable personal use of resources, you may contact it-\\nhelp@andrew.cmu.edu to determine whether a particular activity is permissible. \\nWe reserve the right to restrict personal use of university systems and networks by an \\nindividual or by the community at large, if the use of resources for such activities becomes \\nexcessive.  If you need unlimited access to computer networks for private or business \\npurposes, you can subscribe to a commercial service. \\nFor information regarding the use of resources to produce intellectual property and profit \\nfrom the development of such property see Carnegie Mellon University’s Intellectual \\nProperty Policy and the Policy on Conflict of Interest/Commitment.',\n",
       " '25 \\n \\n \\nPrivacy \\nThe user must presume that the contents of any other users’ directory are private unless \\nexpressly designated otherwise, just as one would presume that the contents of \\nsomeone’s apartment or office are private. The only exceptions to this rule are: that in \\nsome environments, files such as “plan files” may be considered public even if the user \\nhas not expressly designated them as such; and that some services such as web pages \\nand anonymous or “guest access” ftp services may be considered to be public, but only for \\nthose areas not protected by password and which are “obviously” public. An unprotected \\naccount or shared device (such as a shared disk on a networked computer) are not \\nconsidered to be public unless the name or service expressly indicates that it is. In such \\ncases, any files or other data which would appear to be private in nature, by virtue of the \\nfile name or data stored, even if “publicly accessible” should be considered to be private. \\nThe user accessing such files has a responsibility to ask the owner of the files or service if \\nthe files are intended to be publicly accessible before the user does more than a “cursory \\nglance” sufficient to cause the question. \\nA user can explicitly grant access to his or her directories, files or to services run from his \\nor her systems. However, users who issue general or vague invitations to browse through \\ntheir files incur a special obligation to protect any material that they do not wish others to \\nsee. Indeed, all users are urged to maintain protection levels on their files consistent with \\nthe access they are actually willing to give to other users. \\nAccess to Faculty Data  \\nElectronic data on a faculty member’s account, whether stored on a computer in the \\nfaculty member’s office or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that faculty \\nmember, may not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without \\nthe faculty member’s consent, except in cases of emergency or in response to a valid \\nsubpoena, search warrant, or order of a court.

       " '29 \\n \\n \\nProtecting Confidential Information \\nUsers who maintain confidential information, such as records relating to employees or \\nstudents, are responsible for following privacy-related policies, laws, and data use \\nagreements. \\nProtecting Personal Information  \\nAs is described throughout this policy, data transmitted across the university network or \\nstored on university systems may be accessed by others as a result of misuse by an \\nindividual, as an incidental result of the routine operation of the network and systems, or \\nin response to a court subpoena or university investigation into suspected or alleged \\nmisuse. While complete privacy of personal data may not be possible, users who wish to \\nensure a higher degree of privacy for their data are encouraged to use encryption, PGP \\nsecurity, or other techniques to reduce the risk that others may access their data.  \\nMisuse and Inappropriate Behavior \\nThe following activities are expressly prohibited at Carnegie Mellon: \\n• Using a computer system without proper authorization granted through the university, \\ncollege, or department management structure. Some activities such as “port scanning” \\nare not expressly prohibited. However, if the target of such scanning requests that an \\nindividual or system stop performing such actions, the person or system performing \\nthe scans must stop scanning the target machine unless the scans are being carried \\nout by a system administrator who has the authority and responsibility over the \\nmachine(s) being scanned or for the network being used. \\n• Concealing your identity, or assuming the identity of another (e.g., by sending forged \\nelectronic mail). Note that some forms of electronic communication, such as browsing \\nWeb pages, passively “identify” users. Keeping your identity private either by not \\nsetting an identity in your browser or by using a Web-anonymizer in order to protect \\nyourself from being put onto mailing lists is not a violation of this policy. \\n• Sharing your password or account with the specific exception of staff or faculty \\nmembers allowing their administrative support personnel to access their accounts in \\norder to provide services appropriate to their job functions. Note that some policies \\nfor the accessing of specific systems or data (see PCI-DSS Guidelines) explicitly forbid \\nthe sharing of passwords used to access them, and that such restrictions for those \\nspecific systems override this policy.',\n",
       " '30 \\n \\n \\n• Using another person’s computer account, userID, files, or data without appropriate \\npermission, as described in the previous bullet (e.g. using an account found “logged in” \\non a cluster machine). \\n• Deleting or tampering with another user’s files or with information stored by another \\nuser on any information-bearing medium (disk, tape, memory, etc.). Even if the user’s \\nfiles are unprotected, with the exception of files obviously intended for public reading, \\nsuch as Web pages, it is improper for another user to read them unless the owner has \\ngiven permission (e.g. in an announcement in class or on a computer bulletin board). \\n• Attempting to “crack” or guess other users’ passwords. System administrators or those \\nspecifically designated by the administrator or owner of a system may attempt to crack \\npasswords in order to test and enhance the security of the system. In cases where an \\nindividual or department “owns” machines which use password files controlled by \\nanother organization (e.g. Andrew machines or their like), the owner may not attempt \\nto crack passwords without explicit permission by the owners of the password \\ndatabase. \\n• Obtaining passwords by other means, such as password capturing and key logging \\nprograms. \\n• Attempting to circumvent system security (e.g. breaking into a system or using \\nprograms to obtain “root” access), without the explicit permission of the owner of that \\nsystem. \\n• Denying appropriate access to resources to other users (e.g. “ping flooding” another \\nsystem, sending “mail bombs,” or modifying a login file in order to cause a user to not \\nbe able to log in). \\n• Releasing programs such as viruses, Trojan horses, worms, etc., that disrupt other \\nusers, damage software or hardware, disrupt network performance, or replicate \\nthemselves for malicious purpose. \\n• Sending commercial solicitations via electronic mail (i.e. spamming) to individuals, or to \\nnewsgroups or mailing lists where such advertising is not part of the purpose of the \\ngroup or list. (It is permissible to send a commercial solicitation to a “for sale” \\nnewsgroup, provided that the advertisement conforms to other policies and guidelines \\nat Carnegie Mellon.) \\n• Any “mass mailing” which is solicitous in nature, unless the mailing is in the conduct of \\nuniversity business.',\n",
       " \"31 \\n \\n \\n• Reselling of services based on the university network, such as web hosting, mailing \\nservices or the selling of shell accounts. \\n• Running a proxy server which results in inappropriate or unauthorized access to \\nuniversity materials to non-university members. \\n• Advertising commercial businesses or ventures on Web pages hosted by Carnegie \\nMellon, unless prior authorization has been granted. \\n• Using mail messages to harass or intimidate another person (such as by repeatedly \\nsending unwanted mail or broadcasting unsolicited mail). \\n• Violations of any local, state or federal laws, such as the distribution of copyright-\\nprotected materials (e.g. the distribution of commercial software, music or films in \\nelectronic format without appropriate permissions by the owner, even if the user \\ndistributing the materials notifies others of their copyright status). \\n• Tampering with, willful destruction of or theft of any computer equipment, whether it \\nbelongs to the university or to an individual. Tampering includes any deliberate effort \\nto degrade or halt a system, to tie up a system or to compromise the system/network \\nperformance. Willful destruction includes any deliberate disabling or damaging of \\ncomputer systems, peripheral equipment such as scanners or printers, or other \\nfacilities or equipment including the network, and any deliberate destruction or \\nimpairment of software or other users’ files or data. \\n• The unauthorized removal of university or another's computing equipment, which \\nconstitutes theft. \\nThis list should not be considered to be complete or exhaustive. It should, however, serve \\nas a set of examples of obviously inappropriate behaviors. If you are in doubt about the \\nappropriateness of something that you want to do, contact the Computing Services Help \\nCenter at 412-268-HELP, or send mail to it-help@andrew.cmu.edu and ask first. \\nEnforcement \\nInappropriate behavior in the use of computers is punishable under the general university \\npolicies and regulations regarding faculty, students and staff. The offenses mentioned in \\nthis policy range from relatively minor to extremely serious, though even a minor offense \\nmay be treated severely if it is repeated or malicious. Certain offenses may also be subject \\nto prosecution under federal, state or local laws. \\nAppropriate disciplinary action depends not only on the nature of the offense, but also on \\nthe intent and previous history of the offender. The range of possible penalties includes\",\n",
       " '32 \\n \\n \\nreprimands, loss of computing privileges, course failures for students, disciplinary \\nprobation, suspension or dismissal from the university and/or criminal prosecution. \\nOffenses that are minor or appear to be accidental in nature are often handled in a very \\ninformal manner such as through electronic mail. More serious offenses involve formal \\nprocedures pursued through the Division of Student Affairs for students, Human \\nResources and/or the hiring university department or administrative unit for staff, or the \\nFaculty Review Committee for faculty. \\nRestrictions of Privileges During Investigations \\nDuring the course of an investigation of alleged inappropriate or unauthorized use, it may \\nbe necessary to temporarily suspend a user’s network or computing privileges, but only \\nafter determining there is at least a prima facie case against the individual, as well as a \\nrisk to the university or its computing resources if privileges are not revoked. In these \\ncases, it is important to recognize that the restriction of network or computing privileges \\nis intended to protect the system rather than to punish the individual. For example, if a \\ncomputer account has been used to launch an attack on another system, that account will \\nbe rendered inactive until the investigation is complete. This is a necessary action taken to \\nprevent further misuse and does not presume that the account holder initiated the \\nmisuse. Unsubstantiated reports of abuse will not result in the suspension of accounts or \\nnetwork access unless sufficient evidence is provided to show that inappropriate activity \\noccurred. For example, if someone reports that their computer was “attacked” by a \\nCarnegie Mellon system, the burden will be upon the complainant to provide sufficient \\ndata logs or other evidence to show that the incident did, indeed at least appear to be an \\nattack. \\nAdverse Impact on Shared Systems                            \\nThe university reserves the right to discontinue communication with external systems that \\nare known to harbor spammers, account crackers, or phishing sites, despite the fact that \\nthis may restrict certain acceptable communications. When deemed necessary, this action \\nwill be taken to protect the security and safety of our systems. Similarly, there may be \\ncases where a particular service or activity on a given university system will, by the very \\nnature of its legitimate operation, tend to generate attacks from other Internet sites. If \\nthese attacks are frequent and severe enough to cause service interruptions for larger \\nparts of the campus community, it may be necessary to temporarily or permanently \\nremove these systems from the campus network. In cases where such an action is \\ndeemed necessary, network administrators will work with the maintainers of the system \\nto identify alternative methods of network access. In cases where the university restricts',\n",
       " \"33 \\n \\n \\naccess to external sites or removes network access for internal sites, the purpose of the \\naction is to maintain the security and reliability of the computer systems and networks \\nrather than to punish an individual or a site, or to restrict the free expression of ideas. \\nConduct of Classes (Undergraduate Students) \\nStudents are expected to attend all scheduled classes unless the instructor explicitly informs \\nthe class that other ways of doing the work are acceptable. The action to be taken in regard \\nto tardiness, absence from class or making up late work is the responsibility of the individual \\ninstructor; the instructor should consult with the department head and the student's dean if \\nmajor action, such as dropping the student from the course, is being considered. \\nAll classes will be held at their scheduled hour on days immediately before and after all \\nholidays and recesses. Both faculty and students are expected to be present. \\nMembers of athletic teams and other student organizations are permitted to be absent from \\nclasses to participate in authorized contests and presentations, either at home or out of \\ntown, provided the following conditions are met: \\n• All work missed must be made up to the satisfaction of the instructor(s) concerned; \\n• No trip shall involve an absence of more than two days, excluding days when classes are \\nnot scheduled; \\n• The total number of days of absence shall not exceed six per sport or per organization \\nannually; \\n• Instructor(s) may request confirmation from the relevant coach, department or student \\naffairs staff member. \\nTechnology affords many students access to portable devices including cell phones, PDAs, \\nand laptops. It is expected that students will respect the wishes of faculty with regard to the \\nuse of electronic devices within the academic environment. \\nStudents who, because of religious beliefs, cannot attend class may arrange as individuals to \\nbe absent, provided the work missed is made up in a manner satisfactory to the instructor(s) \\nof the class(es) missed. \\nNo student shall leave a scheduled exercise because of the absence of the instructor until a \\nreasonable time has passed. By tradition and as a matter of courtesy a student should wait \\n10 minutes before leaving.\",\n",

Full-time Carnegie \\nMellon degree students are eligible. The PCHE course may not count towards full-time \\nstatus unless the student is enrolled in an inter-university program. There is no additional \\ntuition charge, except for special course or laboratory fees. Carnegie Mellon students do \\nnot acquire status at the host institution, but are given library and bookstore privileges. \\nCredit and grades are transferred directly to the home institution. Cross-registration is not \\napplicable during the Summer Session(s) or during intersessions. \\nThere are nine approved PCHE Institutions in the Pittsburgh area: \\nCarlow University (412-578-6084), Chatham College (412-365-1121), CCAC (412-237-2555), \\nDuquesne University (412-396-6230), LaRoche College (412-367-9300), Pittsburgh \\nTheological Seminary (412-362-5610), Point Park University (412-392-3861), Robert Morris \\nCollege (412-262-8256), University of Pittsburgh (412-624-1544) \\n1. \\nEach college or university accepts registration from the other institutions; however, \\nfirst priority is given to students of the host institution, and not all departments or \\nschools in all institutions are able to participate in this program. \\n2. \\nIn each case of a student cross-registration, the approval of the dean or a designated \\nindividual from the home college or university must be obtained prior to registration. \\n3. \\nIn addition, the student's advisor or dean is responsible for assuring the student's \\neligibility for the course in which he/she intends to enroll. \\n4. \\nFull credit and grades for cross-registered courses will be transferred to the \\nappropriate institution; the academic regulations of the host university will prevail. \\n5. \\nThe academic honesty code and other rules of conduct of the institution providing \\ninstruction apply with respect to its courses and behavior on its campus. That \\ninstitution also determines whether its rules have or have not been violated. The \\nstudent's own institution will impose such penalties as it considers proper when \\nviolations are reported to it.\",\n",
       " '35 \\n \\n \\n6. \\nCross-registrants do not thereby acquire the status of students in the institutions in \\nwhich they are receiving instruction (e.g., for purposes of participation in student \\nactivities, insurance programs, etc.). They do receive library privileges at the host \\ninstitution and may purchase course texts at the host bookstore. \\n7. \\nEach qualified student normally may enroll in no more than one course off campus in \\nany one term or semester under this program. Students wishing to cross-register for \\nmore than one course in a term must have approval from the appropriate academic \\noffices at both schools. \\n8. \\nNo additional tuition charge is made to students who are participating in this \\nprogram; however, the student who cross-registers is responsible for paying any \\ncourse or laboratory fees to the host. \\n9. \\nCross-registration does not apply to summer sessions at any of the institutions. \\n10. Adding or dropping a course after the home institution\\'s deadline date requires \\npermission from the home institution; adding or dropping a course after the host \\ninstitution\\'s deadline date requires permission from the host institution. \\n11. Students enrolled in approved joint co-op programs between two PCHE institutions \\nare exempt from the requirement of being full-time at either school in order to cross \\nregister. Students are bound by the requirements of that program. \\n12. Carnegie Mellon students may not cross-register for required courses that are \\nnormally available at Carnegie Mellon. Exceptions may be made if courses are \\nunavailable or legitimate schedule conflicts seriously hinder completion of degree \\nrequirements within the prescribed timeframe. \\n13. \"PCHE Cross-Registration Request\" forms are available from The HUB. \\nDoctoral Student Status Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe university has a policy that covers: time limits on doctoral student status, a definition \\nof All But Dissertation status, a definition of In Residence and In Absentia status for doctoral \\nstudents and the tuition and fees charged for students In Residence and students In \\nAbsentia.',\n",

       " \"42 \\n \\n \\nExaminations for Undergraduate Courses Policy \\nPreamble \\nThe Faculty Senate adopted the following policies on the administration of examinations \\nfor the undergraduate courses (defined as courses that are numbered 6xx or below). \\nThese policies represent an understanding between faculty and student concerning an \\nimportant but often stressful period, especially at the conclusion of each academic \\nsemester and at mid-semester. There should be no expectation that the following points \\nwill cover every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the \\nexam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize \\nthat the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations \\nduring this period over which he or she has no control: expectations should be reasonably \\nconsistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the \\nstudent well in advance of the final examination period, preferably as part of the course \\nsyllabus. \\nIn order to help students plan their time and study optimally for examinations, this \\ndocument lays out in some detail the policies regarding final and in-term examinations. \\nInstructors are requested to provide notification of the major in-term examinations in the \\ncourse syllabus. The final examination date is posted early in the semester. It is the \\nresponsibility of the student to give his or her instructor sufficient notice and to work with \\nthe instructor to re-schedule examinations if this is needed. \\nDefinitions \\n• Final examination period. The university's official final examination period begins on \\nthe Monday immediately following the last day of classes and continues through the \\nlast day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s). \\n• Scheduled final examinations. Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by \\nthe University Registrar's Office. \\n• Self-scheduled examinations. An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for the \\nfinal examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; \\nsuch exams are called self-scheduled examinations. \\n• Final examinations. Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all \\ncourse materials, or non-comprehensive, covering only a part of the course. \\n• In-term examinations. Major examinations during the semester are referred to here as \\nin-term examinations.\",\n",
       " \"43 \\n \\n \\nPolicies \\nI. In-term Examinations \\n1. \\nAll in-term examinations should be given during the regularly scheduled class time. \\nHowever, if the exam requires additional time to complete, then examinations may \\nbe administered outside of regularly scheduled class time. \\n2. \\nNo examinations given outside of class time (excluding make ups and self-scheduled \\nexaminations) shall be administered on a Friday after 4:30 pm, or at any time \\nSaturday or Sunday. \\n3. \\nThe instructor administering an exam (or another required class event) that falls \\noutside class time must make any and all reasonable accommodations to provide an \\nalternative time to students who have conflicts with the proposed time period, \\nincluding those conflicts due to activities, meetings, other classes, etc. (provided that \\nthe instructor is notified of such conflict in a timely manner). \\n4. \\nNo student shall be required to take more than two full-period in-class or out-of-class \\nexaminations on the same day. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the \\ninstructor in a timely manner of his/her circumstance so that appropriate \\naccommodations can be made. \\nII. Final Examinations \\n1. \\nAll scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the \\nuniversity's official final examination period. Comprehensive final examinations are \\nnot required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or \\ninstructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never \\nbe used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self-\\nscheduled examination during this time. Non-comprehensive final examinations or \\nfinal projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in \\ncourses that do not give a final comprehensive examination. \\n2. \\nInstructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than the last regular day \\nof classes in courses for which there is a final examination. In cases when this is not \\npossible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided \\nunless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been \\nreturned.\",\n",
       " \"44 \\n \\n \\n3. \\nNo other coursework, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final \\nexamination period unless it is assigned in advance and in lieu of the course's final \\nexamination. Regardless of whether there is a final examination in the course, no \\nclasses other than review sessions shall be held during the final examination period. \\nReview sessions should be scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious effort \\nshould be made to accommodate students who cannot attend. In appreciation of the \\ntime required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio \\nreviews, critiques or juries shall be scheduled for the last class day of a course with a \\nfinal examination. \\n4. \\nInstructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that \\npeople can leave earlier nor pressure students to take an examination on a reading \\nday or weekend preceding examinations. \\n5. \\nNo student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start \\nwithin a 25-hour period. A student who has more than two examinations scheduled \\nwithin a 25-hour period or has two examinations scheduled at the same time should \\nfirst contact the instructors of the courses for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the \\nproblem cannot be resolved by that means, the student should contact the associate \\ndean of his or her home college. \\n6. \\nTake-home final examinations shall be given for any 24-hour period of the student's \\nchoosing during the final examination period. \\n7. \\nStudents are expected to present themselves at the place assigned at the start of the \\nexamination; late arrival will reduce the total time a student has to complete the \\nexamination, unless instructor's course policy indicates otherwise. Instructors \\nreserve the right to require attendance within a specific time period. Students who \\nmiss an examination with a reasonable excuse and wish to petition for a make-up \\nfinal examination should check with the instructor. Instructors are encouraged to \\ninclude late arrival policy and make-up exam policy in the course syllabus. \\n8. \\nAny student shall be permitted to review his or her corrected, graded final \\nexamination in the presence of an instructor or a teaching assistant. Any controversy \\narising from this review shall be dealt with in accordance with the university \\nprocedure for the appeal of grades and academic actions. A final examination that is \\nnot returned to a student will be kept available for a year for review.

A faculty member might wish to include a quotation in a \\nbook or distribute an article to her students through a course website.  A student might \\nwant to create a multimedia project incorporating images, film clips, and music samples \\nfor a class assignment.  A librarian may seek to digitally preserve archival material.  The \\nCopyright Act contains many exceptions and limitations that permit the use of a work \\nwithout the permission of the copyright owner, most notably fair use. Although these \\nexceptions have always been important to the academic enterprise, the digital revolution \\nenables a wide range of new uses that significantly enhance the educational and scholarly \\nprocess, thereby increasing the reliance on these exceptions generally, and fair use in \\nparticular. \\nAccording to the Supreme Court, the objectives of the fair use doctrine are to preserve \\nfree speech and to promote creativity. Codified in the Copyright Act of 1976 at 17 U.S.C. § \\n107, the preamble to the fair use doctrine lists six favored purposes: criticism, comment, \\nteaching, scholarship, and research. For this reason, the Supreme Court has recognized \\nthat \"the fair use defense affords considerable latitude for scholarship and comment.\" \\nAfter the preamble, Section 107 sets forth four non-exclusive factors courts must consider \\nin determining whether a use is fair. Courts have broadened their interpretation of the \\nfour factors significantly over time. Recent interpretations have favored educational uses \\ninvolving new technologies. \\nWhen conducting a fair use analysis, members of the University community should \\nconsider (1) the fair use factors and (2) applicable codes of best practices.  The following',\n",
       " '47 \\n \\n \\nguidance is designed to assist members of the University community in conducting a \\nproper fair use analysis. [8] \\n1. The Fair Use Factors \\nMembers of the University community are required by Section 107 to consider and \\nbalance the following factors to determine if a use qualifies as a fair use. The factors \\nshould not be balanced mechanically, but weighed together \"in light of the purposes of \\ncopyright.\" The ultimate test of fair use \"is whether copyright\\'s goal of promoting the \\nProgress of Science and useful Arts would be better served by allowing the use than by \\npreventing it.\" \\nA. The purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial \\nnature or is for nonprofit educational purposes. \\n• Courts have favored nonprofit education uses, including making multiple copies for \\nclassroom use, and \"transformative\" uses where the new use does not supersede the \\noriginally intended use. \\n• The repurposing or re-contextualization of a work can be transformative, even if the \\nwork itself is not modified. \\n• Digitization of works to provide access to the print disabled, to enable indexing, and \\nto enable \"non-consumptive research\" (e.g. text mining) has been considered \\ntransformative. \\nB. Nature of the copyrighted work. \\n• Courts have favored uses of factual works, as opposed to fiction, and uses of \\npublished works as opposed to unpublished works. \\n• If a use is transformative, the nature of the work is less important. \\nC. Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a \\nwhole. \\n• Minimal copying does not trigger infringement liability and thus does not require fair \\nuse analysis. \\n• The extent of permissible copying under fair use varies with the purpose and \\ncharacter of the use. \\n \\n8 This guidance contains citations to some more recent court decisions.  For the sake of brevity not all legal principles in this \\nguidance contain citations.  Please contact the Office of the General Counsel if you have any questions regarding this guidance.',\n",
       " '48 \\n \\n \\n• Copying an entire work may be permissible if necessary to achieve a legitimate \\npurpose. For example, the copying of entire works did not weight against fair use \\nwhen necessary for the purpose of providing access to the print disabled or \\nproviding a search index to complete works. \\n• Copying of a quantitatively small portion of a work can weigh against fair use if the \\nportion used is \"the heart\" of the work. \\n• The inclusion of one chapter of a book in electronic course reserves did not weigh \\nagainst fair use even when the publisher made available licenses for digital excerpts. \\nD. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. \\n• Although in the past this factor was considered to be the most important in the fair \\nuse analysis, this no longer is true. \\n• Courts examine whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original work. \\n• With respect to impact on potential licensing revenue, courts look at \"traditional, \\nreasonable, or likely to be developed markets.\" \\n• Markets for transformative uses are not traditional markets; hence, a transformative \\nuse does not impair the market for purposes of this factor. \\n• Even when a court concluded a use was non-transformative, it considered the \\nadverse impact on a licensing market only if the license was easily accessible, \\nreasonably priced, and available for the portion and format the user sought to use. \\nE. Good Faith of User \\n• Some courts have identified a fifth, non-statutory factor: whether the user acted in \\ngood faith. \\n• This factor should typically weigh in favor of nonprofit educational uses. \\n• Documentation of the user\\'s fair use analysis, such as a fair use checklist or a \\nstatement of pedagogical need, demonstrates the user\\'s good faith. \\nAlthough copyright law generally does not require a user to attribute the source of \\nmaterial, such attribution demonstrates the user\\'s good faith. (Attribution often also is \\nrequired as a matter of academic ethics as well as the terms of a Creative Commons \\nlicense.) \\nIn addition, courts have treated as fair use:',\n",
       " \"49 \\n \\n \\n• Copying incidental to the streaming of films assigned for courses [9]; \\n• Inclusion of chapters of monographs (but not textbooks) in electronic course reserves [10]; \\nand \\n• Mass digitization of books for the purpose of preservation, creating a search index, and \\nproviding access to the print disabled. [11] \\nWhen considering similar uses, members of the University community should treat these \\ndecisions as important guideposts. \\n2. Best Practices \\nSeveral educational communities have developed codes of best practices in fair use.[12] \\nThese codes each represent a community's consensus about acceptable practices for the \\nfair use of copyrighted materials.  Legal scholarship has demonstrated that courts give \\nweight to what a relevant community considers to be acceptable practice.  When \\nexercising the fair use doctrine, members of the University community should consult and \\nfollow the appropriate code of best practices. \\nIn particular, the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries (see \\nlink below) articulates a set of principles for how fair use applies to certain common \\npractices in the university setting. The Code sets forth limitations that should be observed \\nto assure that the case for fair use is strong, and enhancements that could further \\nstrengthen that case. These principles include that it is fair use to: \\n• Make appropriately tailored course-related content available to enrolled students via \\ndigital networks; \\n• Make digital copies for purposes of preservation, and to make these copies available \\nas surrogates for fragile and inaccessible materials; \\n• Create digital versions of a library's special collections and to make these versions \\nelectronically accessible in appropriate contexts; \\n \\n9 Association for Info.

Like the \\njudicial determinations of fair use, this Code of Best Practices should inform the fair use \\ncalculus performed by members of the University community.[13] \\nAlthough the judicial decisions and the Codes of Best Practices are instructive, members of \\nthe University must consider the application of the fair use doctrine to the unique facts of \\nthe proposed used. \\nFinal Examinations for Graduate Courses \\nThere is no university policy on the administration of final examinations for the graduate \\ncourses. Students should consult their department or college handbooks for applicable \\npolicies. Concerns related to final examinations for graduate courses may be directed to the \\ncourse instructor, the department head of the instructor offering the course, or to the \\ngraduate associate dean (or equivalent) of the student’s home college. \\nFor information pertaining to final examinations for undergraduate students, please review \\nthe Examinations for Undergraduate Students Policy. \\nFinancial Aid Policy \\nStatement \\nUniversity Academic Scholarship Renewals \\nCarnegie Mellon University awards academic scholarships as part of the freshman \\nfinancial aid process. Each of these scholarships is renewable for four academic years of \\n \\n13 As noted above, other fair use Codes of Best Practices may be relevant as well.',\n",
       " \"51 \\n \\n \\nstudy (five for architecture) based upon the maintenance of a specific cumulative quality \\npoint average. The academic scholarship renewal criteria are included in the scholarship \\nnotification letter which is mailed to the student prior to the May 1 matriculation deadline. \\nEach scholarship recipient's cumulative quality point average is reviewed at the end of \\neach academic year. If the student achieves the scholarship renewal criteria, then the \\nscholarship is automatically renewed for the next academic year. \\nIf the student does not meet the cumulative quality point average requirement for \\nrenewal, then s/he is given the opportunity to appeal. A merit scholarship appeal form \\nand instructions are automatically sent to the student at the end of each academic year. \\nThe student's completed appeal form is reviewed by members of the Enrollment Services \\nstaff. Input from the Associate Dean of the student's college is also considered. The \\nstudent is notified, in writing, of the decision. The decision may be to renew the \\nscholarship for the entire academic year, renew the scholarship for one academic term, or \\nto reject the appeal. If the appeal is rejected, a written explanation is provided to the \\nstudent. \\nUndergraduate Tuition Exchange Programs \\nCarnegie Mellon University assesses the standard tuition charge for the undergraduate \\ntuition exchange programs. \\nSince Carnegie Mellon assesses the tuition charge, the student can be considered for all \\nforms of institutional, state, and federal aid for which the student may have eligibility with \\nthe exception of any student employment program. \\nUndergraduate Study Abroad Programs \\nCarnegie Mellon University does not assess the tuition charge for any of the Study Abroad \\nPrograms. \\nSince Carnegie Mellon does not assess the tuition charge, the student is not considered \\nfor any institutional grants and scholarships. However, Carnegie Mellon will consider any \\nstudent participating in an approved Study Abroad Program for all state and federal \\nstudent aid programs for which the student may have eligibility with the exception of any \\nstudent employment program. \\nThe U.S. Department of Education and Carnegie Mellon University define an approved \\nStudy Abroad Program as one which is part of a contractual agreement between Carnegie \\nMellon and the host institution. Additionally, courses taken in the Study Abroad Program \\nmust be accepted for transfer to Carnegie Mellon by the Dean of the student's college.\",\n",
       " '52 \\n \\n \\nUndergraduate International Students \\nFor purposes of undergraduate student financial aid, an International Student is defined \\nas someone who is neither a U.S. citizen nor an eligible noncitizen. The U.S. Department \\nof Education defines an eligible noncitizen as: \\n1. An individual who is a permanent resident of the United States (as evidenced by an I-\\n151 or I-551 card); or \\n2. An individual who can provide documentation from the U.S. Immigration and \\nNaturalization Service (INS) that s/he is in the United States for other than a temporary \\npurpose with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident of the United \\nStates. \\nAn undergraduate, International Student is ineligible to receive any federal or state \\nstudent financial aid. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon does not award any institutional \\nfinancial aid funds to undergraduate International Students. \\nFinancial Obligations \\nStudents should pay the amounts due on their E-Bill by the due date on their invoice. Past \\ndue accounts are subject to a 1.5% penalty charge each month until the balance is paid in \\nfull.   \\nAll financial obligations to the university need to be met or future enrollment and other \\nservices may be affected. These obligations include, but are not limited to, tuition, fees, room \\nand board, student health insurance, library or parking fines, or any other charges due to the \\nuniversity. \\nGrading Policies \\nPolicy Statement \\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking \\ncourses, whether those students are undergraduates, non-degree students or graduate \\nstudents. This policy covers the specifics of Assigning and Changing Grades (including \\nFinal and Mid-Semester grades, Incompletes and Conditional Failures), Grading Options \\n(Audit and Pass/Fail), Drop/Withdrawals, Course Repeats, and defines the undergraduate \\nand graduate Grading Standards.',\n",
       " \"53 \\n \\n \\nQuestions about grading for a specific course should be addressed to the instructor of the \\ncourse in question. Graduate students with questions about Pass/Fail and \\nDrop/Withdrawal should contact their individual programs. \\nAppeals for an exception to any grading policy may be made by the dean's office of the \\nstudent’s home college. \\n1. Definitions \\nCertain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section. \\n• Student means any full-time or part-time degree-seeking undergraduate or graduate \\nstudent, or full-time or part-time non-degree student. \\n• Non-degree student means a student that is not in a university degree program. \\n• Faculty means members of the university's Faculty Organization as defined in the \\nFaculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first \\nyear), and part-time faculty. \\n• Instructor means a faculty member, teaching assistant, and /or lecturer who is the \\ninstructor of record, as recorded in the Student Information System (SIS). \\n2. Policy Provisions \\nAssigning Grades \\nFinal grades are awarded to each student, in each course scheduled, at the end of the \\nsemester, mini-semester or summer session. All students taking a course at Carnegie \\nMellon must be assigned grades. \\nEnrollment Services will query instructors who do not assign a grade to a student. Copies \\nof the query regarding the lack of grade will be sent to the student, to the dean and to the \\ndepartment head. If the instructor does not assign a letter grade or an incomplete grade \\nwithin one month of Enrollment Service’s query, the department head will be responsible \\nfor insuring that a grade is assigned. \\nChanging a Grade \\nA student who believes that an assigned grade is incorrect, may request that a final grade \\nbe changed. Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with \\nthe approval of the instructor and, for undergraduates, with the approval of the dean’s \\noffice of the college/school offering the course; for graduate students, department \\napproval is required. The intention of this policy is to insure that, under normal\",\n",
       " \"54 \\n \\n \\ncircumstances, all students in a class are treated equally and no student is unduly \\nadvantaged. \\nMid-Semester Grades \\nMid-semester grades provide valuable feedback to students as they assess their \\nperformance in courses. Furthermore, mid-semester grades and the QPA's they generate \\nare used by Deans and advisors in identifying and dealing in a timely way with students in \\nacademic trouble. Therefore it is imperative that mid-semester grades accurately reflect \\nstudent performance and are turned in on time. \\nMid-semester grades are not permanent and are kept only until final grades are recorded. \\nBecause mid-semester grades are not permanent, changes of mid-semester grades as a \\nrule will not be accepted. \\nIncomplete Grades \\nCarnegie Mellon students are expected to complete a course during the academic \\nsemester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of I \\n(incomplete) may be given when a student, for reasons beyond his or her control, has \\nbeen unable to complete the work of a course, but the work completed to date is of \\npassing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student \\nover other students. \\nIn awarding an I grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for completing the \\nwork and designate a default letter grade where no further work is submitted. Students \\nmust complete the required course work no later than the end of the following academic \\nsemester, or sooner if required by prior agreement. The instructor must record the \\npermanent grade by the last day of the examination period of that following semester, or \\nEnrollment Services will administratively assign the default grade. \\nPass/Fail Grades \\nUndergraduate students may elect to take a free-elective course pass/fail unless \\nprecluded by the course, the course's department or the student's home \\ndepartment/college. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised \\nto check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. A student must \\nsubmit a Grade Option Request Form to Enrollment Services indicating the course they \\nare electing as pass/fail before the end of the university's withdraw period. This decision is \\nirreversible thereafter. No information regarding the student's decision will be passed on \\nto the instructor. Instructors will submit letter grades, which will automatically be \\nconverted to pass/fail.\",\n",
       " \"55 \\n \\n \\nA through D work will receive credit for units passed and be recorded as P on the \\nstudent's academic record; below D work will receive no credit and will be recorded as N \\non the student's academic record. No quality points will be assigned to P or N units; P or N \\nunits will not be factored into the student's QPA. \\nIn exceptional circumstances, departments may ask to designate a course pass/fail or \\nrequest that the course be evaluated only with letter grades. The College Council must \\napprove designating a course as pass/fail only or as graded only. If such a decision will \\nhave an adverse effect on the requirements of any other college, Academic Council must \\nreview the decision. The decision to designate a course as graded or pass/fail must be \\nmade before the add period for the course and is irreversible thereafter. \\nAudit Grades \\nAuditing is presence in the classroom without receiving academic credit, a pass/fail or a \\nletter grade. The extent of a student’s participation must be arranged and approved by \\nthe course instructor. A student wishing to audit a course is required to register for the \\ncourse, complete the Course Audit Approval Form, obtain permission of the course \\ninstructor and their advisor, and return the form to The HUB prior to the last day to add a \\ncourse. \\nAny student enrolled full-time (36 units) may audit a course without additional charges. \\nPart-time or non-degree students who choose to audit a course will be assessed tuition at \\nthe regular per-unit tuition rate. \\nDrop/Withdrawal Grades \\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon may drop a course by accessing on-line registration on or \\nbefore the drop deadline as published in the official university calendar. This applies to all \\ncourses with the exception of mini-semester courses. Policies for graduate students vary \\nand students should be advised to check with their individual \\ncolleges/departments/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini-semester course \\nis the last day of the second week of the mini-semester course. When a course is dropped \\nby these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record. \\nAfter the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on-line \\nregistration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After \\nthe deadline to drop, a W (withdrawal) grade is assigned and appears on the student's \\nacademic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. \\nStudents may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the \\ndeadline during the pursuit of their degree. This action must be taken through \\nconsultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop\",\n",

Full-time is defined as \\nregistered for a minimum of 36 units. Permission to drop below the 36-unit minimum can \\nonly be granted in extraordinary circumstances by the student's home Associate Dean. \\nUndergraduates who are registered as part-time are also subject to the above deadlines \\nto drop or withdraw from a course. \\nCourse Repeats \\nWhen a course is repeated, all grades will be recorded on the official academic transcript \\nand will be calculated in the student’s QPA. This is the case regardless if the first grade for \\nthe course is a passing or failing grade. \\nUndergraduate students who wish to repeat a course already passed must obtain \\napproval from the student's Dean or Department Head. When a student takes a course \\ns/he has already passed, only one set of units will count towards graduation \\nrequirements. \\n3.

As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the \\nuniversity must establish procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of \\nresearch with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the \\nallegations, and the university. Furthermore, federal regulations require the university to \\nhave explicit procedures for addressing incidents in which there are allegations of \\nmisconduct in research. \\nIntroduction \\nThis document outlines the procedures to be followed when misconduct in research is \\nalleged at Carnegie Mellon. As defined by the National Science Foundation: [14] \\n\"Misconduct means (1) fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other serious deviation \\nfrom accepted practices in proposing, carrying out, or reporting results from research; (2) \\nmaterial failure to comply with Federal requirements for the protection of researchers, \\nhuman subjects, or the public or for ensuring the welfare of laboratory animals; or (3) \\nfailure to meet other material legal requirements governing research.\" \\n \\n14 National Science Foundation. 45 CFR Part 689. \"Misconduct in Science and Engineering Research,\" Federal Register.

       " '59 \\n \\n \\nTo be deemed misconduct for the purposes of this policy, a \"material failure to comply \\nwith Federal requirements\" or a \"failure to meet other material legal requirements\" must \\nbe intentional or grossly negligent. \\nIn conjunction with the procedures outlined in this policy, the provost is responsible for \\ncomplying with applicable federal regulations, including notifying sponsoring agencies at \\nthe appropriate time[15] and keeping those involved, Committees of Inquiry and \\nCommittees of Investigation, well informed with respect to the requirements of these \\nagencies. If at any time it appears that the possibility exists that the alleged misconduct \\nmight involve a violation of any federal, state or local criminal statute, the university \\nattorney must be consulted immediately to determine further action. \\nAllegations \\nQuestions about, or suspicions of, misconduct in research should be brought to the \\nattention of the provost for confidential counseling and possible informal resolution. \\nAllegations of misconduct shall be presented to the provost in writing. Anonymous \\nreports will not be accepted. The provost will acknowledge allegations in writing to the \\nclaimant. [16] \\nAfter a review of the allegation, the provost must decide within 15 days whether a \\nCommittee of Inquiry is needed and, if so, establish such a committee promptly. The \\nclaimant must be informed, in writing, of the provost\\'s decision. \\nIf a decision is made to establish a Committee of Inquiry, the respondent[17] must be \\ninformed in writing of the allegation, advised of the initiation of the inquiry process, and \\nasked to provide information. \\nCommittee of Inquiry \\nThe provost shall appoint a three-member Committee of Inquiry. Committee members \\nshould be faculty or staff who, in the judgment of the provost, have the appropriate \\nseniority and knowledge to assess the alleged misconduct and do not have a conflict of \\ninterest that would interfere with an objective review. \\n \\n15 Currently, NSF requires notification when it is decided that a formal investigation will be undertaken; however, it should be \\nborne in mind that guidelines in many agencies are currently under development, so it would be impossible to incorporate such \\nguidelines in this policy. \\n16 \"Claimant\" and \"respondent\" are the terms used by the Association of American Universities in their draft document, \\nFramework for Institutional Policies and Procedures for Fraud in Research, August, 1988. We have chosen to use these terms in this \\ndocument.

       " '60 \\n \\n \\nThe provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Inquiry to conduct a discreet inquiry \\nbased on communication with the respondent and the claimant. The purpose of the \\ninquiry is to determine if there is reason to believe that misconduct has occurred. The \\ninquiry should be limited to activities necessary to determine whether to recommend a \\nformal investigation. \\nThe identities of the respondent and claimant will be kept confidential by members of the \\ncommittee, if possible. \\nIf a majority of the members of the committee of Inquiry recommend that a formal \\ninvestigation be conducted, the provost must establish a Committee of Investigation. If \\nonly a minority of the members of the Committee of Inquiry recommend a formal \\ninvestigation, the provost may either dismiss the allegation or establish a Committee of \\nInvestigation. \\nIf the Committee of Inquiry determines that the allegations have been made in a \\ncapricious or malicious manner, they will report this to the provost for appropriate action. \\nThe Committee of Inquiry has 30 days to conduct the inquiry. If the inquiry cannot be \\nreasonably completed within 30 days, the Committee may request a 30-day extension \\nfrom the provost. \\nIf a decision is made to establish a Committee of Investigation, the respondent must be \\ninformed of the identity of the claimant, shown all of the documents and evidence that \\nrelate to the charges, and given 15 days to respond prior to initiating the investigation. \\nSponsoring agencies shall be informed if appropriate or mandated. \\nCommittee of Investigation \\nThe Committee of Investigation shall have five members, none of whom was a member of \\nthe Committee of Inquiry. The provost will appoint two members. The chairmen of the \\nUniversity Research Council, the Faculty Review Committee, and the faculty will each \\nappoint one member. \\nThe provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Investigation to conduct a thorough \\ninvestigation of the allegation. The committee should have access to all persons and \\ninformation needed to determine the extent to which misconduct has occurred. \\nOtherwise, the investigation should be as confidential as possible. \\nThe Committee of Investigation shall prepare a written report documenting the extent to \\nwhich misconduct has occurred.

The \\nuniversity believes that review independent of the investigator is necessary to safeguard \\nthe rights and welfare of human subjects of research investigations. All research involving \\nhuman subjects is conducted in accordance with federal regulations, including Title 45 of \\nthe Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46 (45 CFR 46). Under federal regulations, human \\nsubjects are defined as: living individual(s) about whom an investigator conducting \\nresearch obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) \\nidentifiable private information. \\nAn Institutional Review Board (IRB) is established under the provost to ensure adequate \\nsafeguards. The provost is responsible for the composition of the IRB with respect to: (1) \\nthe qualifications of IRB members in terms of educational background and research or \\nother relevant experience, and (2) broad representation of relevant university interests. \\nThis IRB is responsible for reviewing investigational procedures involving human subjects \\nprior to the initiation of the research procedure in reference to (1) the rights and welfare \\nof the individuals involved, (2) the appropriateness of the methods used to obtain \\ninformed consent, and (3) the risks and potential benefits of the investigations. The IRB is \\nresponsible for determining when additional expertise is required for adequate review \\nand for obtaining that additional expertise. The IRB is further responsible for maintaining \\nrecords of its review activities and decisions and for ensuring that records of informed \\nconsent are developed and kept by investigators where appropriate. \\nIt is the responsibility of investigators who plan to use human subjects in research to \\nobtain written consent from the IRB prior to conducting an investigation involving human \\nsubjects. It is the investigator's further responsibility to take whatever steps are\",\n",

Purpose \\nThe policy reflects the following goals: \\n• To create a university environment that encourages the generation of new knowledge \\nby faculty, staff, and students. \\n• To facilitate wide transfer of useful inventions and writings to society. \\n• To motivate the development and dissemination of intellectual property by providing \\nappropriate financial rewards to creators and the university, and administrative \\nassistance to creators. \\n• To ensure that the financial return from the development of intellectual property does \\nnot distort decisions and operations of the university in a manner contrary to the \\nmission of the university. \\nThe policy is based upon the following principles relating the university to society: \\n• The mission of the university remains the generation and dissemination of knowledge. \\n• Intellectual property will be generated within the university, and there exists an \\nobligation to disseminate it. An interface is needed if better technology transfer is to \\nbe achieved, and the university will provide mechanisms for that function.[17] \\nThe policy is based upon the following principles relating faculty, staff and students to the \\nuniversity. \\n• Intellectual property is created by individuals, or by groups of individuals, who are \\nentitled to choose the course of disclosure; academic freedom of individuals is a \\nhigher priority than possible financial rewards. \\n• There exists an historical tradition allowing authors to retain ownership of intellectual \\nproperty rights from textbooks and works of art. \\n \\n17 This document presumes the existence of a university office to facilitate technology transfer. Such an office would serve as a \\nclearinghouse for contacts with outside partners, would perform patent and copyright tasks, and would develop an effective \\nmarketing capability.',\n",
       " \"64 \\n \\n \\n• The university is the support of the whole campus community, and is thereby entitled \\nto share in financial rewards. \\n• There should be incentives for all parties to pursue financial rewards together, \\nconsistent with the expressed goals of the policy. The distribution of these rewards \\nshould reflect, insofar as possible, the creative contributions of the creator, and the \\nresources contributed by and risks assumed by both the creator and the university in \\ndeveloping intellectual property. \\n• Since it is frequently difficult to meaningfully assess risks, resources and potential \\nrewards, negotiated agreements are to be encouraged whenever possible. \\n2.  Definitions \\nCertain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section. \\nThese definitions do not necessarily conform to customary usage. \\n• Intellectual Property includes any patentable invention, any copyrightable subject \\nmatter, or trade secret. It also includes works of art, and inventions or creations that \\nmight normally be developed on a proprietary basis. \\n• University means Carnegie Mellon. \\n• Student means any full-time or part-time graduate or undergraduate student, \\nregardless of whether the student receives financial aid from the university or from \\noutside sources. It is the responsibility of students who are also employees of other \\noutside entities to resolve any conflicts between this policy and provisions of \\nagreements with their employers prior to beginning any undertaking at the university \\nthat will involve the development of intellectual property. \\n• Faculty means members of the university's Faculty Organization as defined in the \\nFaculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first \\nyear), and part-time faculty. \\n• Staff means any employee of the university other than students and faculty as defined \\nabove. If a student is also a part-time university employee, he is considered as staff \\nwith regard to intellectual property developed as a result of his employment, and as a \\nstudent with regard to other intellectual property. A full-time non-faculty employee \\nwho is also taking one or more courses is considered to be staff. Visitors to the \\nuniversity who make substantial use of university resources are considered as staff \\nwith respect to any intellectual property arising from such use. (The distinction \\nbetween faculty and staff does not affect intellectual property rights except for \\nrepresentation on the Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee [see Section 5]).\",\n",
       " '65 \\n \\n \\n• Creator means any person or persons who create an item of intellectual property. \\n• Net proceeds to the university means all proceeds received by the university on \\nintellectual property that it assigns, sells or licenses, minus any application, litigation, \\ninterference, or marketing costs directly attributable to the intellectual property being \\nlicensed. Deducted costs shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; \\nthe sources and amounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed. \\n• Net proceeds to the creator means all proceeds received by the creator from \\nintellectual property owned by him that he sells, assigns or licenses, less the costs of \\napplication, legal protection, or litigation, interference, travel and other marketing \\ncosts directly attributable to the intellectual property being exploited. Such net \\nproceeds do not include compensation legitimately received by the creator for \\nconsulting services or interest or other return on invested labor or capital. Deducted \\ncosts shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; the sources and \\namounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed. \\n• Substantial use of university facilities means extensive unreimbursed use of major \\nuniversity laboratory, studio or computational facilities, or human resources. The use \\nof these facilities must be important to the creation of the intellectual property; merely \\nincidental use of a facility does not constitute substantial use, nor does extensive use \\nof a facility commonly available to all faculty or professional staff (such as libraries and \\noffices), nor does extensive use of a specialized facility for routine tasks. Use will be \\nconsidered \"extensive\" and facilities will be considered \"major\" if similar use of similar \\nfacilities would cost the creator more than $5000 (five thousand dollars) in constant \\n1984 dollars if purchased or leased in the public market. Creators wishing to directly \\nreimburse the University for the use of its facilities must make arrangements to do so \\nbefore the level of facilities usage for a particular intellectual property becomes \\nsubstantial. (This provision is not intended to override any other department or \\nuniversity policy concerning reimbursement for facilities usage.) \\nIn General: \\nIn any given year the equivalent figure for a particular amount of money in constant 1984 \\ndollars will be obtained by multiplying that amount of money by the ratio of the most \\nrecent quarterly Disposable Personal Income Deflator divided by the average monthly \\nDisposable Personal Income Deflator for the year 1984. \\nAs used in this policy, the masculine gender includes the feminine gender, singular or \\nplural, wherever appropriate.',\n",
       " '66 \\n \\n \\n3.  Policy Provisions \\nThis section states the policies concerning ownership of intellectual property created at \\nthe university. In order of precedence, ownership of intellectual property shall be as \\nfollows: \\n3-1. Externally Sponsored Work \\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property created as a result of work conducted under \\nan agreement between an external sponsor and the university that specifies the \\nownership of such intellectual property shall be owned as specified in said agreement. If \\nthe university declares itself to be a sponsor, but does not declare itself to be the owner of \\nthe intellectual property, ownership shall be determined in accordance with 3-6-4 below. \\nProcedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the \\nuniversity to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by an \\nexternally sponsored contract of the intellectual property provisions of that contract in \\nadvance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to be in writing and the \\nuniversity may require written acknowledgment of such provisions by any person working \\non externally sponsored projects. A summary of external sponsorship agreements limiting \\nthe intellectual property rights of potential creators will be maintained by the Office of \\nSponsored Research and will be available to the general university community. \\nIf the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed \\non his intellectual property rights by external sponsorship agreements, the creator is \\nentitled to receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the \\nuniversity resulting from his intellectual property. \\n3-2. Internally Sponsored Work \\nOwnership Provisions: When the university provides funds or facilities for a particular \\nproject to the extent of substantial use, it may also choose to designate itself as sponsor \\nof that work. The university may declare itself the owner of intellectual property resulting \\nfrom said work. In such cases the university must specify in advance the disposition of any \\nintellectual property rights arising from the project. If the university declares itself to be a \\nsponsor, but does not declare itself the owner of the intellectual property, ownership shall \\nbe determined in accordance with 3-6-4 below. \\nProcedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the \\nuniversity to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by \\ninternally sponsored work of the intellectual property ownership rights specified by the \\nuniversity as to that work in advance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to',\n",
       " \"67 \\n \\n \\nbe in writing and the university may require written acknowledgment of such provisions \\nby any person working on internally sponsored projects. A summary of work for which \\nuniversity sponsorship limits the intellectual property rights of potential creators will be \\nmaintained by the Office of Sponsored Research and will be available to the general \\nuniversity community. \\nIf the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed \\non his intellectual property rights by internal university sponsorship, the creator is entitled \\nto receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university \\nresulting from his intellectual property. \\n3-3. Individual Agreements \\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property which is the subject of a specific agreement \\nbetween the university and the creator(s) thereof shall be owned as provided in said \\nagreement. Such agreements by the university and the faculty are encouraged. \\nProcedural Provisions: Except where limited by external sponsorship agreements, \\ncreators and the university may negotiate individual agreements to govern ownership of \\nintellectual property regardless of the applicability of any other provision hereof. \\n3-4. Intellectual Property Created Within Scope of Employment \\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property created by university employees who were \\nemployed specifically to produce a particular intellectual property shall be owned by the \\nuniversity if said intellectual property was created within the normal scope of their \\nemployment. Faculty are presumed not to be hired to produce a particular intellectual \\nproperty. On the other hand, computer programs written on the job by staff computer \\nprogrammers would fall under this provision. \\n3-5. Public Dedication \\nOwnership Provisions: Except when limited by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3 or 3-4 above, the \\ncreator of any intellectual property may choose to place his or her creation in the public \\ndomain. In such cases both the creator and the university waive all ownership rights to \\nsaid property. \\nProcedural Provisions: Creators wishing to place their intellectual property in the public \\ndomain are responsible for ascertaining that the right to public dedication of that \\nintellectual property is not limited by any external agreement, university sponsorship \\narrangement or terms of employment as described in Provisions 3-1, 3-2 or 3-3 above. \\nThe university provost will provide such a determination in writing upon request by the \\ncreator. It is also the creator's responsibility to ensure that disclosure does not include\",\n",
       " '68 \\n \\n \\nvaluable intellectual property owned by others. (This provision does not release the \\nuniversity from its general obligation to notify creators of limitations to intellectual \\nproperty rights specified in Provisions 3-1 and 3-2 above.) \\nTo facilitate the actual transfer of knowledge of the intellectual property to the public at \\nlarge, the creator shall provide the university with a complete description and \\ndocumentation of the property placed in the public domain, specifically including a copy \\nof the property in the case of printed material, and complete machine-readable source \\ncode in the case of software. All such material provided to the university will be placed in \\nthe University Library and made available to the public at large. The university will take \\nappropriate action on a regular basis to publicize summary descriptions of intellectual \\nproperty recently placed in the public domain. The university will also provide any \\nmember of the general public copies of such material on a cost-recovery basis. \\nThe provisions of this section do not apply to the normal scholarly or creative publication \\nprocesses unless the creator intends to waive all proprietary rights to the publication. \\n3-6. In General \\nUnless governed by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4 or 3-5 above, ownership of intellectual \\nproperty created at the university shall be determined as follows: \\n3-6-1. Traditional Rights Retained \\nOwnership Provisions: In keeping with academic traditions at the university, the creator \\nretains all rights to the following types of intellectual property, without limitation: books \\n(including textbooks), educational courseware, articles, non-fiction, novels, poems, \\nmusical works, dramatic works including any accompanying music, pantomimes and \\nchoreographic works, pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, motion pictures and other \\nsimilar audio-visual works, and sound recordings, regardless of the level of use of \\nuniversity facilities. This provision does not include computer software (other than \\neducational courseware) or data bases. \\nProcedural Provisions: The types of intellectual property listed in the preceding \\nparagraph share the attribute that they display information or visual or auditory \\nappearances which are fully revealed to the purchaser or consumer. Thus, for example, \\nsource code listings would also be considered within this category. On the other hand, \\nmost computer software and data bases do not share this attribute; they are \\ncharacterized by their capacity to perform tasks. Because of their utilitarian nature, \\nownership rights with respect thereto are governed by 3-6-3 or 3-6-4. Educational \\ncourseware is included in this provision in all cases because of its role in furthering the \\nprimary educational mission of the university.',\n",
       " '69 \\n \\n \\nThis provision applies regardless of any university sponsorship of the work, and it may \\nbe modified only by a specific prior agreement between the creator and the university. \\nThe use of university-owned computers and other facilities in the preparation of books \\nand similar works does not alter this provision, though other university policies may \\nlimit such use or require reimbursement to the university. Similarly, the use of externally \\nsponsored resources does not alter this provision, unless the creator is effectively \\nnotified in advance of such limitations to his rights in accordance with 3-1. \\n3-6-2. No Substantial Use of University Facilities \\nOwnership Provisions: The creator owns all intellectual property created without \\nsubstantial use of university facilities, including intellectual property rights in computer \\nsoftware and data bases. \\n3-6-3. Substantial Use of University Facilities - No External or Internal Sponsorship \\nOwnership of intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities, \\nbut not directly arising from externally sponsored work, or from work for which the \\nuniversity has declared itself as sponsor, shall be determined as set forth hereinafter \\ndepending on whether the creator or the university develops said property. \\n3-6-3-1. Development by Creator \\nOwnership Provisions: The creator originally owns intellectual property created with \\nsubstantial use of university facilities but no external or internal sponsorship, and \\nretains said ownership by commercial development of said property subject to the \\nfollowing: (i) the university shall receive 15% (fifteen percent) of the net proceeds to \\nthe creator above $25,000 (twenty-five thousand dollars) in constant 1984 dollars \\nfrom all sources (in the case of patents and copyrights, this provision shall be limited \\nto the life of the patent or copyright), and (ii) the university shall receive a perpetual, \\nnon-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty free license to use said intellectual property. \\nIn the case of software, this license includes access by specified university personnel \\nto the source listings, and the university shall require each person to whom a \\ndisclosure is made to execute in advance a binding confidentiality agreement in favor \\nof and enforceable by the creator. If the intellectual property is created solely by a \\nstudent or students, the creator is exempt from the obligation to pay to the \\nuniversity a fraction of his net proceeds, but not from the provision of this paragraph \\nfor a non-exclusive license to the university.',\n",
       " \"70 \\n \\n \\nProcedural Provisions: If the creator develops an intellectual property that is covered \\nby this provision, he must make full and fair disclosure to the University of all such \\nsources of compensation relating to that intellectual property. \\n3-6-3-2. Development by the University \\nOwnership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of \\nuniversity facilities, but not directly arising from sponsored research, the creator will \\noriginally retain the rights to the property, provided that he desires to commercially \\ndevelop the property himself or to make it available to the public. If, however, the \\ncreator elects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in \\npursuing such development, then the ownership rights to that property may be \\nacquired by the university. Intellectual property acquired by the university in this \\nfashion will be treated as in 3-6-4-1 below. \\nProcedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual property is disclosed to the \\nuniversity's provost as required under Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the \\nuniversity may request that the creator decide whether he will develop the \\nintellectual property or will grant the rights to the university, and execute documents \\nto pass on the title. Such a decision must be made within one year of the request or \\nthe creator will automatically lose his rights in favor of the university. \\n3-6-4. Substantial Use of University Facilities - External or Internal Sponsorship \\nOwnership of intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities \\nand directly arising from work sponsored under an agreement between an external \\nsponsor and the university, or from work for which the university has declared itself a \\nsponsor, but for which neither the external sponsor nor the university have specified the \\nownership of resulting intellectual property shall be determined as set forth hereinafter \\ndepending on whether the creator or the university develops said property. \\n3-6-4-1. Development by University \\nOwnership Provisions: The University originally owns intellectual property created \\nwith substantial use of university facilities provided by an external agreement or \\ninternal university sponsorship and retains said ownership by commercial \\ndevelopment of said property, subject to the following: in all cases, the creator shall \\nreceive 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university. \\nProcedural Provisions: When an intellectual property is created with substantial use \\nof university resources provided by an external research contract or a specific \\nuniversity sponsorship agreement, and when that contract or agreement either does\",\n",
       " \"71 \\n \\n \\nnot specify the disposition of the intellectual property rights arising from that \\nsponsorship, or it permits the university and/or creator to retain or acquire such \\nintellectual property rights, the university will originally retain the rights to such \\nintellectual property. \\n3-6-4-2. Development by Creator \\nOwnership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of \\nuniversity facilities provided by external or internal sponsorship, the university will \\noriginally retain the rights to the property, provided that it desires to commercially \\ndevelop the property or to make it available to the public. If, however, the university \\nelects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in such \\ndevelopment, the ownership rights to that property may be acquired by the creator. \\nIntellectual property acquired by the creator in this fashion will be treated as in 3-6-3-\\n1 above. This assignment of rights to the creator may be prohibited by the terms of \\nan external sponsorship agreement with the university or by an internal university \\nsponsorship declaration, but in such cases the creator must be notified in advance, \\nas in Provisions 3-1 and 3-2. \\nProcedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual property is disclosed to the \\nuniversity's provost as required by Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the creator \\nmay request that the university decide whether it will commercially develop the \\nintellectual property or execute an assignment of the intellectual property rights to \\nthe creator. Such a decision must be made within 120 (one hundred twenty) days of \\nthe request or the university automatically waives its rights in favor of the creator, \\nand it must execute an assignment of these rights to the creator. \\n3-6-5. Consulting Agreements \\nOwnership Provisions: Work done by individuals as consultants to outside firms is \\npresumed not to involve unreimbursed substantial use of university facilities, and the \\nrights to intellectual property created under consulting agreements are retained by the \\noutside firms or the individual as specified by the terms of the consulting agreement \\nand the terms of Provision 3-6-2 above. \\nProcedural Provisions: Under university policy consulting work must not make \\nsubstantial unreimbursed use of university facilities except by explicit prior agreement. \\nAny member of the university community who is engaged in consulting work or in \\nbusiness is responsible for ensuring that provisions in his agreements are not in conflict \\nwith this policy of the university or with the university's commitments. The university's \\nInnovation Transfer Office will, upon request, provide assistance in this respect. The\",\n",
       " \"72 \\n \\n \\nuniversity's rights and the individual's obligations to the university are in no way \\nabrogated or limited by the terms of such agreements. Each creator of intellectual \\nproperty should make his obligations to the university clear to those with whom he \\nmakes such agreements and should ensure that they are provided with a current \\nstatement of the university's intellectual property policy. Appropriate sample contract \\nwording to cover various possible external consulting arrangements shall be available \\nfrom the university provost. \\n4.  General Procedures \\n4-1. \\nThe creator of any intellectual property that is or might be owned by the university under \\nthis policy is required to make reasonably prompt written disclosure of the work to the \\nuniversity's provost, and to execute any document deemed necessary to perfect legal \\nrights in the university and enable the university to file patent applications and \\napplications for copyright registration when appropriate. This disclosure to the provost \\nshould be made at the time when legal protection for the creation is contemplated, and it \\nmust be made before the intellectual property is sold, used for profit, or disclosed to the \\npublic. Whenever legal protection for intellectual property is anticipated all persons \\nengaged in such creative activity are encouraged to keep regular notebooks and records. \\n4-2. \\nWhenever the university undertakes commercial development it shall do so, if possible, in \\na fashion that provides for the widest possible dissemination, avoiding suppression of \\ninventions from which the public might otherwise benefit, providing for non-exclusive \\nlicensing at reasonable royalties, and giving consideration to more favorable or royalty-\\nfree licensing to non-profit charitable institutions, minority businesses or enterprises in \\ndeveloping countries. \\n4-3. \\nThe university's share of any proceeds under this policy will be used to reimburse the \\nUniversity for its expenses for commercial development of intellectual property. Any \\nadditional return to the university will be used to further the academic purposes of all the \\ndisciplines of the entire university. \\n5.

It also mandates a procedure, to be implemented by the radiation safety \\nofficer, for ensuring that the radiation exposure of a woman who officially declares her \\npregnancy does not exceed the level set by federal regulations. \\nInformation and Training \\nThe radiation safety officer shall provide training sessions in which all students and \\nemployees, including supervisors, who are to work in restricted radiation areas are \\ninformed, orally and in writing, about this Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy and about \\npotential radiation and non-radiation effects on a developing embryo/fetus. At these \\nsessions, attendees are given the opportunity to have questions answered. The radiation \\nsafety officer may, at his or her discretion, administer an oral and/or written exam in \\norder to confirm attendees' understanding of the subject matter. \\nThe radiation safety officer obtains from each attendee a signed acknowledgment of \\nunderstanding of the Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy. No employee or student may \\nenter a radiologically restricted area before attending such a training session and signing \\nsuch an acknowledgment of understanding.\",\n",

To be considered an official declaration of pregnancy, this must be in \\nwriting and contain the estimated date of conception. An official declaration of pregnancy \\nform can be obtained from the radiation safety officer. \\nA pregnant woman has no obligation to officially declare her pregnancy. \\nLimiting Exposure \\nUpon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, the radiation safety officer shall work \\nwith the declared pregnant woman\\'s supervisor to review the work being performed by \\nthe declared pregnant woman and determine whether exposure is likely to exceed 500 \\nmilligrams during the pregnancy and/or likely to substantially vary from month to month \\nduring the pregnancy. If exposure greater than 500 millirems or significant variation is \\ndetermined to be likely, the radiation safety officer and supervisor shall identify and \\nimplement appropriate precautions and engineering controls to limit radiation dose \\nand/or decrease month-to-month variations. \\nThe radiation safety officer shall also, upon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, \\ncomplete a dose assessment on the declared pregnant woman, including sending her \\nwhole body radiation dosimeter to an approved laboratory for processing, and possibly \\nincluding bioassay by urinalysis. The radiation safety officer shall communicate to the \\ndeclared pregnant woman the results of the dose assessment. \\nOnce a month, the radiation safety officer shall monitor the external occupational dose to \\na declared pregnant woman using a whole body radiation dosimeter, unless the radiation \\nsafety officer considers it unlikely that the embryo/fetus will receive, from sources outside \\nthe body of the declared pregnant woman, a dose in excess of 100 milligrams during the \\ncourse of the pregnancy. \\nThe radiation safety officer shall monitor the occupational intake, by bioassay if necessary, \\nof radioactive material by a declared pregnant woman, unless the radiation safety officer \\nconsiders it unlikely that the declared pregnant woman will receive a \"Committed Effective \\nDose Equivalent\" in excess of 100 milligrams during the course of the pregnancy, in',\n",

       " \"80 \\n \\n \\nResearch Proposals: Government, Corporations and Foundations \\nPolicy \\nPolicy Statement \\nSponsored research is an important part of the mission of the university and accounts for \\na significant portion of the university's expenditures in a given year. The large amount of \\nresearch that is supported by government, industry and foundations brings with it a \\nmyriad of constantly changing legal, financial and administrative requirements which \\nmust be taken into account. Because of the complexity of all these factors, it is important \\nthat all proposals, contracts and agreements related to research activities be reviewed \\ncentrally to ensure compliance with government regulations and university policies. \\nSignatures and Approvals \\nIn general, research proposals require two sets of signatures: those required by the \\nfunding organization and those required by Carnegie Mellon. No proposal should be sent \\nout of the university without the appropriate signatures. \\nAll research proposals to the government and to corporations should be circulated \\ninternally and should be accompanied by a Carnegie Mellon Proposal Routing and Sign-off \\nSheet. The sign-off sheet ensures that everyone involved in the process has had the \\nopportunity to review the proposal. \\nThe following signatures are required on the sign-off sheet: \\n• Principal investigators: their signatures state that they understand their commitments \\nto the project and agree to meet their obligations as set forth in the proposal. \\n• Deans and the department heads: their signatures attest that they support the \\nproposal and that all matters relating to space, facilities and personnel can be resolved \\nwithin the department and the college. In instances of joint proposals, signatures from \\nall department heads and deans are required. \\n• Signatures from the Office of Sponsored Research and Provost's Office indicate that \\nthe proposal and the budget have been reviewed and that they meet the requirements \\nof both the university and the potential sponsor. \\nResearch proposals to foundations - whether initiated within the college or the \\nDevelopment Office - must also be reviewed and signed by the Provost's Office.\",\n",
       " \"81 \\n \\n \\nNegotiation of the Award \\nAfter an award is made to the university, the Office of Sponsored Research will enter into \\nsponsored research or contract negotiations. The principal investigator will be responsible \\nfor negotiating technical aspects of the agreement. The remainder of the negotiations will \\nbe the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research or the Office of the Associate \\nProvost for Research and Academic Administration. All research agreements must be \\nsigned by either the provost or the associate provost for research and academic \\nadministration. No other personnel are authorized to commit the university to a research \\nagreement. \\nRestricted Research Policy \\nStatement \\nUniversities have two primary purposes: to create knowledge and to disseminate \\nknowledge. Carnegie Mellon University recognizes the importance of open intellectual \\ncommunication within a research group, within the university, and within the larger \\ncommunity outside. Ideally, all units of the university would disseminate the results of \\nresearch as quickly and as widely as possible. Some members or units of the university, \\nhowever, desire to do research that may be difficult or impossible without restrictions or \\nwithout access to classified or proprietary materials. \\nThere exists, therefore, a tension between the university's goal of disseminating \\nknowledge freely and the desire on the part of some of its members to conduct restricted \\nresearch on important problems. The university intends to guarantee the academic \\nfreedom of all faculty members to do research in their own manner on topics of their own \\nchoosing, provided that such research is consistent with the overall purposes of the \\nuniversity. \\nThis policy seeks to resolve the tension between the desire to participate in restricted \\nresearch and the desire to maintain the open atmosphere of the university by confining \\nrestricted research to semi-autonomous units, which are not associated with any \\nacademic departments. It thereby establishes the principle that restricted research is \\ninappropriate at Carnegie Mellon University except in the semi-autonomous units. \\nThis policy does not attempt to anticipate all possible concerns about restricted research. \\nIn some cases, decisions will need to be made about particular research projects to which \\nthe application of particular policy guidelines are not clear. In choosing to accept or \\ndecline such projects, the university will weigh the potential of a project for generating\",\n",
       " '82 \\n \\n \\nand disseminating new knowledge, for the benefit of society, against the project\\'s \\npotential for adversely affecting the climate for research conducted in a free and open \\nenvironment. While this policy sets no explicit limits on the extent of classified research \\npermitted in the semi-autonomous units, it is not the intent of the policy to encourage any \\nunit of the university to engage in classified research as a primary ongoing activity. \\nIndeed, it is expected that classified projects will never represent more than a small \\nfraction of the total research effort in any unit. \\nDefinitions \\n• Research: all projects and investigations involving the creation of new knowledge of a \\ntheoretical or practical nature. The term \"research\" as used here encompasses both \\n\"research\" and \"development\" as they are commonly defined. \\n• Classified research: research, the free dissemination of the results of which is deemed \\nto jeopardize national security. The federal government controls access to the \\nenvironment in which such research is performed, restricts discussions about the work \\nin progress to individuals with clearance and a \"need to know,\" and limits publication \\nof research, results or access to data needed to verify results, for a specified period of \\ntime. \\n• Proprietary research: research that results in intellectual property that is owned by \\nentities other than Carnegie Mellon University. Such entities may wish to market \\nproducts derived from inventions or ideas that are developed at the university. They \\nmight, therefore, desire to fund projects which restrict access to data and to \\ndiscussions about work in progress to individuals with a \"need to know,\" and to seek, \\nfor a specified period of time, a delay in publication of research results or data needed \\nto verify results. Such entities may also provide access to proprietary material, which \\nresearchers must agree not to include in publications. \\n• Publication: oral or written dissemination. \\n• Restricted research: includes all classified research, and any proprietary or other \\nresearch that requires more than a six month delay in publication of the research \\nresults. \\n• Semi-autonomous units: units of the university specifically so designated by the \\npresident, after consultation with the URC and the Faculty Senate, currently the Mellon \\nInstitute and the Software Engineering Institute. \\n• Non-autonomous units: all university entities other than semi-autonomous units.',\n",
       " \"83 \\n \\n \\nRestricted Research in Non-Autonomous Units \\nIt is the policy of Carnegie Mellon that restricted research is inappropriate and, therefore, \\nnot permitted within its non-autonomous units. \\nIt is also the policy of Carnegie Mellon not to permit involvement of students in projects \\nwhich carry restrictions that may impede their progress toward a degree. Therefore, \\nstudents should not be involved in contracts that require the delay of a student's \\npublication of research results when such results are intended for use in obtaining \\nacademic credit, except that a sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of \\npublications for removal of proprietary information that was provided by the sponsor for \\nthe conduct of the research. \\nProprietary research is allowed within non-autonomous units provided it is subject to \\nlimitations (excluding students' publications as noted above) no more stringent than the \\nfollowing: \\n• A sponsor may request a delay of up to six months in publication so that steps may be \\ntaken to secure intellectual property rights to inventions or ideas developed under the \\ncontract. \\n• A sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of publications for removal of \\nproprietary information which was provided for the conduct of the research. \\nConsiderations for Faculty/Researchers \\nThe university recognizes that problems arise in both restricted research and research \\nthat is not itself restricted but that involves access to classified or propriety information or \\nmaterials (hereinafter, restricted materials). Researchers may also have access to \\nrestricted materials when serving as consultants. Access to restricted materials gives rise \\nto concerns about limitations on researchers' freedom to communicate. In such instances, \\nresearchers must exercise considerable judgment to conduct their research in an open \\nenvironment while protecting the restricted materials to which they have access. \\nResearchers must also be aware that the university will judge their performance as \\nresearchers through their publications or through other scholarly products that arise \\nfrom their research. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not available for \\npublic review, cannot be considered in promotion or reappointment decisions or in \\nevaluations of academic performance of any kind. \\nConsiderations for Students \\nThere are important concerns about the involvement of students in restricted research. It \\nis necessary for students to publish their work in order to obtain degrees, course credit\",\n",
       " \"84 \\n \\n \\nand professional recognition. Students rely to a large degree on their faculty advisor's \\njudgment for guidance and advice. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not \\navailable for public review, cannot be used for academic credit. Thus, before working on \\nsuch research, a student must be notified in writing that work on this research may not be \\nused for academic credit. \\nRestricted Research in Semi-Autonomous Units \\nThe semi-autonomous units associated with Carnegie Mellon may conduct restricted \\nresearch. \\nFaculty members may conduct restricted research in or in cooperation with semi-\\nautonomous units only on a consulting basis or by means of a formal, internal leave of \\nabsence from their non-autonomous units. \\nWork that is restricted in any way may not be used for academic evaluations until it is \\nreleased for publication, and then only with respect to future academic actions. \\nStudents may occasionally be employed by the semi-autonomous units, provided that \\nsuch employment does not interfere substantially with progress toward a degree. \\nHowever, they must be made aware that work that is restricted cannot be used for \\nacademic credit. Work that was restricted and is later released for dissemination and \\nreview can be applied toward future academic credit. Students should be discouraged \\nfrom working on restricted research in which dissemination may be delayed indefinitely. \\nGuidelines for all Units \\nWork by students on restricted research projects shall not be made a condition for \\nadmission or financial aid. \\nThe principal investigator is responsible for informing all members of a project (faculty, \\nstaff and students) of any restrictions imposed on the dissemination of information \\nrelated to the research. This must be done prior to the start of the project or prior to an \\nindividual joining an existing project. \\nRestrictions on access to university facilities due to the conduct of restricted research \\nmust be kept to a minimum. Access to and movement through the facilities in which \\nrestricted research is conducted must be consistent with standard university procedures. \\nThe Provost's Office is responsible for obtaining signed documents from principal \\ninvestigators on restricted research projects attesting that they are aware of all \\nrestrictions imposed on the research and that they have informed all participants of these \\nrestrictions.\",\n",
       " \"85 \\n \\n \\nThe Office of Sponsored Research shall review all proposals and contracts prior to \\napproval for conformity with these guidelines. Any that do not meet these guidelines will \\nbe referred to the University Research Council (URC) for review and recommendation of \\nappropriate action to the provost. \\nTo maintain a balance with the university's goals of broad dissemination of knowledge, \\nthe URC will conduct an annual review of all restricted research being conducted at the \\nuniversity. This review will be made based on a listing of all contracts that involve \\nrestricted research. This listing shall include the title and sponsor(s) of the research, \\nname(s) of principal investigator(s), and the amount of funding of each contract. \\nThe university community will be informed annually, through the URC's written report to \\nthe Faculty Senate and Student Senate, of the nature and overall impact of restricted \\nresearch at Carnegie Mellon. \\nExisting sponsored research projects shall be allowed to continue under the terms of their \\npresent contract. However, renewal contracts must conform with this policy. \\nRetention of Student Work Policy \\nThe university reserves the right in all colleges to retain indefinitely any student work the \\nfaculty may select. All work not retained by the university must be claimed at the time \\nspecified on the bulletin boards (or other forms of communication) of the department \\nconcerned; otherwise, the work will be destroyed. \\nStatute of Limitations – Master’s Studies \\nStudents will complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven \\nyears from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more \\nrestrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the \\nperson may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently \\noffered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program. \\nUnder extenuating circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family \\nor parental leave, or temporary disability, a college/school may, upon the relevant \\ndepartment's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), \\ndefer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students \\nwho are pursuing the master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their \\nprogram, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for \\nextension of the time to degree limit.\",\n",
       " \"86 \\n \\n \\nStatute of Limitations – Undergraduate Students \\nAll units required for an undergraduate degree, whether earned in residence, transferred \\nfrom another institution or granted via advanced placement, must have been earned within \\neight years of the date on which the degree is granted. This statutory period can be extended \\nby the dean of the student's college under the following conditions: \\n• the courses taken prior to the statutory period still represent a reasonable part of the \\nstudent's total academic program; \\n• the prior courses provide adequate preparation for courses which must still be taken to \\nfulfill the degree requirements; \\n• there is a legitimate reason(s) for the student not completing the academic program \\nwithin the statutory period. \\nA request for a waiver of the statute of limitations must be submitted to the dean of the \\nstudent's college. The request for a waiver should address all of the above conditions for an \\nextension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, the waiver covers specific courses and is \\nintended for a specific period during which the program must be completed. \\nStudent Leaves Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nStudents must sometimes interrupt their studies for a variety of reasons (financial, \\nacademic or personal).

A Withdrawal Form must be completed by all students who are withdrawing. \\nNotifying instructors or no longer attending classes does not complete the process. Forms \\nare available on The HUB website. Not completing the leave form results in tuition being \\ncharged to midpoint of the semester or the last date the student attended an \\nacademically-related activity such as an exam, tutorial or study group, or the last day a \\nstudent turned in a class assignment.\",\n",

Students should also consult with their academic \\nadvisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of \\nStudents. \\nAccommodations for Gestational Parents \\nThe birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic \\npursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose \\nanticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away \\nfrom their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are \\nafforded two options as possible accommodation: \\n• Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents – A short term absence from \\nacademic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks.  Short-Term \\nAccommodation may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where \\na longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with \\nrelevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and \\nother academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include \\nextensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping \\ncourses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who \\ntake a Short-Term Accommodation will remain enrolled.  \\n• Formal Leave of Absence– A formal leave of absence under the Student Leaves Policy.  \\nGenerally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-\\nsemester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the \\nleave is taken.  Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence drop all remaining courses \\nfor the semester and are unenrolled for the semester.  International students must \\nconsult with the Office of International Education before considering this option due to \\nvisa implications. \\nParental Accommodation for Doctoral Students \\nThe university offers a Parental Accommodation for qualifying doctoral student parents to \\ninclude up to four (4) weeks of time away from academic responsibilities with continued \\nstipend support.

In order to be considered for return from leave, a student \\nmust first obtain an Application for Return form from The HUB or their academic \\ndepartment. This application requires information from the student regarding the intended',\n",
       " \"95 \\n \\n \\nsemester of return, current address information and information about their leave. This \\napplication must be submitted to their home department at least one month prior to the \\nbeginning of the semester. \\nUndergraduates may return within their same academic department within two years. After \\ntwo years, students returning in the same academic department are subject to space \\nconstraints and academic performance review. Graduate students must negotiate their \\nreturn with their home department and must follow their department policy. \\nThe Application for Return requires approval of the student's academic department and \\ndean. If a student's department chooses to deny the student's Application for Return, the \\nstudent may appeal to their dean. Any constraints governing the student's eligibility to return \\nwill be specified directly on the application by the academic department and/or dean's office \\nor the Office of Student Affairs. \\nStudents who have taken courses elsewhere must submit an official transcript and course \\ndescriptions with their Application for Return. Transfer credit approval is determined by the \\nacademic department based on course level, performance and appropriateness to the \\nstudent's curriculum requirements. Credit transfer is subject to college-specific policy. Failure \\nto submit the necessary documents at the time of return will result in denial of transfer \\ncredit. \\nThe process of returning is not completed until all necessary signatures on the Return form \\nare obtained by the student and until all outstanding bills are paid. Enrollment Services will \\nthen notify the appropriate university offices of the student's return. \\nStudents’ Rights Policy \\nThe primary right of students is to pursue their education so long as they maintain their \\neligibility to remain a member of the community by meeting its academic standards and so \\nlong as they observe the regulations imposed by the university for the governance of the \\nacademic community. \\nThe second right of students is to be recognized as members of the student body, with all the \\nprivileges pursuant thereto as to use of physical plant, university services and facilities. \\nEvery student has the constitutional rights and responsibilities of any citizen under the law. \\nConversely, a responsibility of any student is to respect these rights of any other member of \\nthe university community. \\nA student has the right to expect that academic and professional processes should be flexible \\nand periodically open to review and to participate constructively with faculty and\",\n",

There are three \\ntypes of suspension for students that apply to both graduate and undergraduate \\nstudents: \\nAcademic Suspension is the result of poor academic performance or violation of academic \\nregulations and is imposed by the student's college or academic department (see \\nuniversity and college academic policies). \\nDisciplinary Suspension is the result of serious personal misconduct and is imposed by the \\nOffice of Student Affairs (see The Word: Student Handbook). \\nAdministrative Suspension is the result of failure to meet university financial obligations or \\nfailure to comply with federal, state or local health regulations and is imposed by \\nEnrollment Services. (See Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures \\nfor financial obligations. Contact University Health Services for information about health \\nregulations.) \\nSuspended students may not: \\n• register for courses \\n• attend classes \\n• live in student or fraternity/sorority housing \\n• use campus facilities, including athletic facilities, library and computer clusters \\n• participate in student activities \\n• be members of student organizations \\n• have student jobs \\n(Note: students on academic suspension may have a summer campus job if they accepted \\nthe job before they were suspended.)\",\n",
       " \"97 \\n \\n \\nEmployment \\nAlthough suspended students may not hold student jobs, students on academic \\nsuspension may, under certain circumstances, have a non-student job with the university; \\nstudents on disciplinary or administrative suspension may not. \\nTo have a non-student job, students on academic suspension must receive approval from \\ntheir associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students) to \\nensure that the job will not violate their suspension terms. Students in violation of this will \\nlose their degree student status, meaning they would have to reapply for admission to \\nCarnegie Mellon through either Undergraduate Admission or the appropriate graduate \\ndepartment. \\nTransfer Credit \\nSuspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer \\ncredit only if their college's and department's policies allow this. \\nAppeals \\nTo appeal any action of this policy, the student may write to the following people: \\nAcademic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head \\n(graduate students); \\nDisciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; \\nAdministrative Suspension - vice president for enrollment, vice president for business and \\nplanning, and the dean of student affairs, in consultation with the student's associate \\ndean. \\nReturning from Suspension \\nIn order to return from a suspension, a student must have the following approval: \\nAcademic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head \\n(graduate students); \\nDisciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; \\nAdministrative Suspension - vice president for campus affairs or designate.\",\n",
       " \"98 \\n \\n \\nSummary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures \\nIntroduction \\nSet forth below is a summary of the processes available to graduate students who seek \\nreview of academic and non-academic issues.  Generally, graduate students are expected \\nto seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or \\nprogram before invoking formal processes.  When an informal resolution cannot be \\nreached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow \\nthese formal procedures.  To the extent that these processes are set forth in official \\nUniversity policies, links to those statements of policy and more detailed description of \\nprocesses and procedures are included. Where a graduate student's concerns implicate \\nmultiple policies or processes, the University reserves the right to decide which process \\nshall apply in order to avoid duplicative and potentially conflicting processes and \\ndecisions, or in appropriate circumstances, the order in which multiple reviews may occur.   \\nThese appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs \\nof the University.  Students should refer to the online handbooks (or hard copy \\nhandbooks if applicable) for their particular programs for more detailed information \\nabout the administration and academic policies of the program.  To the extent that these \\npolicies conflict in any way with policies, processes and procedures adopted at the \\nCollege, Department or Program level, the policies set forth herein shall govern. \\nAppealing Final Grades \\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval \\nof the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound \\ndiscretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the \\ninstructor who assigned the grade.  The following circumstances are the unusual \\nexceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is \\nbased on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade \\nor failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who \\nassigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy.  \\nA graduate student who believes a final grade was assigned pursuant to (a) or (b) above \\nshould first present the case informally to the faculty or staff member responsible for the \\ncourse in which the student believes an inappropriate grade has been awarded. Grade \\nappeals should be initiated as soon as possible but no later than one year after the final \\ncourse grade was issued.  If the student is not satisfied with the resolution at this first \\nstep, the student shall submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate documentation\",\n",
       " '99 \\n \\n \\nto the head of the department in which the course was offered.  The department head (or \\nthe program head if the department head chooses to delegate the decision to him/her) \\nwill issue a written decision on the appeal within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as \\npractical.  If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the department head (or \\nprogram head), the student may submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate \\ndocumentation, within seven (7) days to the Dean of the college in which the course is \\noffered. The Dean shall render a decision within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as \\npractical.  The decision of the Dean shall be final and not appealable. \\nSummary of Levels of Appeal for Final Grades: \\n• Informal discussion with the faculty member \\n• Formal written appeal to the department head (or the program head if the department \\nhead chooses to delegate the decision to him/her) \\n• Formal written appeal to the Dean \\n• Dean issues final non-appealable decision \\nSee, also, Carnegie Mellon University Grading Policies. \\nAppeal of Academic Actions \\nAn \"Academic Action\" is an action by a program, unit or department based on a graduate \\nstudent\\'s academic performance or failure to satisfy academic program requirements.  \\nExamples of Academic Actions include, but are not limited to, academic probation, \\nacademic suspension, and dismissal/drop.  Each college, department, or program may set \\nits own academic requirements and standards for acceptable academic performance.  \\nThese standards and benchmarks for performance are set forth in the online and/or hard \\ncopy handbooks for individual graduate programs. \\nGraduate students will be notified of an academic action in writing by the applicable \\ndepartment, unit, or program head or director, or designated committee.  Graduate \\nstudents are encouraged to seek informal resolution of any concerns related to academic \\nactions informally within the department, unit or program before filing a formal appeal.   \\nGraduate students who wish to appeal an Academic Action must submit a formal, written \\nappeal, with appropriate documentation, to the Dean of the College within seven (7) \\ncalendar days after receipt of written notice of the academic action by the department, \\nunit, or program head or director, or designated committee.  The Dean may delegate \\nreview of the matter to another individual or committee, including but not limited to one \\nof the Associate Deans, the College Council or a specially constituted grievance committee',\n",

A copy of the appeal must also be \\nsubmitted to the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education and to the Dean.  The \\nProvost may delegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, including \\nbut not limited to the Vice Provost for Education who shall make a recommendation to \\nthe Provost.  The Provost shall render a decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days or as \\nsoon thereafter as practical.  Decisions by the Provost are final and not appealable.   \\nGenerally, sanctions resulting from an Academic Action (e.g. probation, suspension, or \\ndismissal /drop) take effect immediately, regardless of whether an appeal is filed.  In \\nexceptional circumstances, however, the appropriate Dean or the Provost may elect to \\nhold sanctions in abeyance pending the resolution of an appeal. \\nSummary of Levels of Appeal for Academic Actions: \\n• Seek informal resolution within department, unit, or program \\n• Formal written appeal to the Dean \\n• Decision rendered by the Dean \\n• Formal written appeal to the Provost  \\n• Provost issues final non-appealable decision \\nAppeal from Academic Disciplinary Actions \\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions are sanctions and outcomes imposed when any student \\nviolates the University Policy on Academic integrity including cheating, plagiarism an \\nunauthorized assistance. \\nThe Office of Community Standards and Integrity manages the Academic Disciplinary \\nProcess and provides resources to all students, faculty and staff.

As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the \\nUniversity has established procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of \\nresearch with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the \\nallegations, and the University.  The procedures for handling allegations of research \\nmisconduct are set forth in the Policy for Handling Alleged Misconduct in Research at \\nCarnegie Mellon University. \\nFor graduate students found responsible for research misconduct, the President of the \\nUniversity may impose specific sanctions up to and including expulsion.  The imposition of \\nsanctions is subject to the procedures for approval and/or appeal prescribed for \\ncommunity standards violations. \\nReturn from Leave of Absence \\nGraduate students who wish to return to Carnegie Mellon following a leave of absence \\nmust follow the procedures set forth in the Student Return Policy. \\nGenerally, graduate students must negotiate their return to the University with their \\nhome academic department and follow any applicable departmental policies.

Statement \\nGraduate student awards given by the university may be subject to U.S. federal, state and \\nlocal income (wage) taxes and required withholdings. This Policy explains the U.S. federal, \\nstate and local income (wage) taxation and withholding for graduate student awards given \\nby the university. \\nII. U.S. Federal Personal Income Tax (and Tax Status) \\na. U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents \\nTo fulfill its legal obligations, the university treats graduate student awards by the \\nuniversity in the form of scholarships, fellowships, teaching assistantships, research \\nassistantships and stipends as being subject to U.S. federal personal income tax as \\nfollows:\",\n",
       " '105 \\n \\n \\n• If a graduate student is not a degree candidate, all award funds are subject to tax. \\n• If a graduate student is a degree candidate, the amount of any award used for tuition, \\nfees and required books, supplies and equipment is not subject to tax. The amount \\nused for other expenses such as room, board and travel is subject to tax. \\n• If a graduate student incurs business and/or travel expenses on the university’s behalf \\nand submits the expense reimbursement in compliance with the university’s Business \\nand Travel Expense (BTE) Policy, these expenses are not subject to tax. \\n• The part of any award that represents payment for the student\\'s services such as \\nteaching, research or other service (e.g., writing, administrative assistance, etc.) is \\nsubject to tax. \\nIn computing graduate student taxable income for purposes of required tax withholdings \\nand any required informational returns, the university can determine centrally the part of \\na graduate student\\'s award that covers tuition and required university fees, since the \\nuniversity publishes these costs. If departments submit to the HR Service Center a \\nmonthly award amount in addition to tuition and required fees, the entire additional \\namount is subject to tax. It is the graduate students’ responsibility to determine the \\nportion of their award used for any additional required fees and expenses (e.g., books, \\nsupplies and equipment). \\nThe university excludes the amount of the graduate student\\'s award used for tuition and \\nrequired university fees from the amount of taxable income shown on the graduate \\nstudent’s IRS Form W-2. \\nGraduate students who have questions about the U.S. federal personal income tax \\nconsequences of their graduate student awards should consult their own personal tax \\nadvisor or refer to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 970, \"Tax Benefits for \\nEducation.\" Non-resident alien graduate students may also wish to review the “Students \\nand Apprentices” section of IRS Publication 901, \"U.S. Tax Treaties.\" These IRS \\npublications, and more information about U.S. federal income taxes, may be found at \\nwww.irs.gov. \\nb. Foreign Students and Permanent Residents \\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. citizens and permanent residents are \\nconsidered residents, but foreign graduate students may be considered residents or non-\\nresidents for tax purposes. Information on tax residency status may be found in IRS \\nPublication 519, “U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.” Some foreign graduate students may benefit \\nfrom specific tax treaties between the U.S. and their home countries. Information on tax',\n",
       " '106 \\n \\n \\ntreaties is contained in IRS Publication 901, “U.S. Tax Treaties.” These IRS publications, and \\nmore information on U.S. federal income taxes, may be found at www.irs.gov. \\nIII. Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax \\nThe following applies only for those graduate students providing services within \\nPennsylvania. Therefore, if the graduate student is providing services at a university \\nlocation in another state as part of the degree requirements that state’s income tax may \\nbe withheld from fellowship or stipend payments. \\nFor purposes of Pennsylvania personal income tax and required withholdings, to fulfill its \\nlegal obligations, the university treats fellowship awards and stipends as taxable \\ncompensation for services if the recipient is required to apply his skill and training to \\nadvance research, creative work, or some other project or activity, unless the recipient is a \\ncandidate for a degree and the same activities are required of all candidates for that \\ndegree as a condition to receiving the degree. Thus, as long as the services rendered by a \\ngraduate student are a standard part of the degree requirements for all students in the \\nstudent’s program, the university will not withhold Pennsylvania personal income tax from \\nthe student’s award/stipend. At the university, when graduate students are required to \\nrender services, those services are generally required to be rendered as a standard part \\nof the degree requirements for the relevant degree program; as long as departments \\nconfirm that the services are required to be rendered as a standard part of the degree \\nprogram, the university will not withhold Pennsylvania personal income tax from \\nfellowship awards or stipends for students performing those services. \\nFurther information about Pennsylvania personal income taxes may be obtained by \\nvisiting the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue website. \\nIV. City of Pittsburgh/Pittsburgh Public School District Earned Income Tax (Wage \\nTax) \\nThe following applies only for those graduate students providing services within \\nPennsylvania. Therefore, if the graduate student is providing services at a university \\nlocation in another state as part of the degree requirements that state’s income tax may \\nbe withheld from fellowship or stipend payments. \\nTo fulfill its legal obligations, the university treats compensation that is subject to the \\nPennsylvania personal income tax (and required Pennsylvania personal income tax \\nwithholdings) as compensation that is subject to the City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh \\nPublic School District’s local earned income (wage) tax (EIT). Therefore, if an award is not \\nconsidered by the university to be compensation for purposes of the Pennsylvania',\n",
       " \"107 \\n \\n \\npersonal income tax, it is not considered compensation for the EIT. As a result, the \\nuniversity does not withhold EIT from graduate students for fellowship awards and \\nstipends that are not subject to Pennsylvania personal income tax withholding. \\nFurther information about the City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Public School District EIT \\nmay be obtained by visiting the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Finance website. \\nV. Assistance in Responding to Correspondence from Taxing Bodies \\nShould a graduate student receive correspondence from the Pennsylvania Department of \\nRevenue and/or the City of Pittsburgh (on behalf of itself and the Pittsburgh Public School \\nDistrict) erroneously seeking to tax some or all of a fellowship award or stipend that was \\npaid to the student for services rendered in Pennsylvania, and required to be rendered as \\na standard part of the degree requirements for the student’s degree program, the \\ngraduate student's department should contact the HR Service Center to obtain a letter to \\ncomplete on behalf of the graduate student citing the relevant Pennsylvania or EIT, as \\napplicable, exclusion from tax. \\nIf requested, the HR Service Center will provide the tax year and income paid to the \\ndepartment, and the remaining information will be completed by the department before \\nproviding it to the graduate student. The letter should be sent by the graduate student to \\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Revenue and/or the City of Pittsburgh, as the case may \\nbe. \\nTemporary Emergency Closing of the University Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nCarnegie Mellon University has an important commitment to students, employees, \\nparents, sponsors, benefactors and the community. Accordingly, the university will make \\nevery attempt to operate normally during severe weather or other emergencies. This \\nincludes holding classes, conducting research programs, and operating facilities and \\nservices. The university will attempt to operate normally unless such operation represents \\na clear threat to the health and safety of students, staff, faculty and visitors. \\nIn the event of severe weather or other emergencies, the Emergency Preparedness and \\nResponse Team will assess the situation and provide recommendations to university \\nleadership as to whether the university can continue normal operations, if normal \\noperations including in-person classes, meetings, events and student activities should be \\nconducted remotely, or if normal operations should be suspended.

The Academic Advisor may be designated by the department to disseminate relevant \\ncorrespondence related to academic disciplinary action within the department according to \\ndepartmental procedure. \\n• Academic Disciplinary Action: Academic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed for \\nviolations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism, and \\nunauthorized assistance.  \\n• Academic Integrity Liaison: Each department designates an individual who is trained by the \\nOffice of Community Standards and Integrity to provide guidance to course instructors in \\ncases of alleged violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. Absent a \\ndepartmental designation, the associate dean of the college in which the course is housed is \\nthe default liaison for consultation purposes. \\n• Course Failure: A grade of “R” as outlined in the University Policy on Grading. \\n• Course Instructor: Any person responsible for the instruction or grading of a course at the \\nuniversity as documented in the Schedule of Classes. \\n• Department Head: The university faculty or staff member who leads an academic \\ndepartment.

In all cases involving alleged violations of the University Policy on \\nAcademic Integrity, the following procedures apply:',\n",
       " '118 \\n \\n \\nGathering Information \\n1. \\nSuspected violations should be investigated within a reasonable timeframe, ideally \\nwithin one to two weeks of discovering the alleged violation. \\n2. \\nInstructors should notify the involved student(s) of the alleged violation(s) and provide \\nthe student(s) the opportunity to respond in an in person meeting or by phone or \\nvideoconference as circumstances warrant. \\n3. \\nCourse instructors may receive information from other individuals (e.g., students, staff, \\nfaculty) who possess direct information related to the alleged violation(s) under review. \\nFor example, someone may have observed the suspected incident or interacted directly \\nwith the involved student(s) before, during, or after the incident in question.  \\n4. \\nWhen discussing alleged violations with the involved student(s) or witnesses, instructors \\nshould avoid revealing the identity of other involved parties unless it is necessary in \\norder to determine responsibility. \\n5. \\nIf a student does not respond to notification of an alleged violation(s) of the University \\nPolicy on Academic Integrity, the matter may be reviewed in their absence by the course \\ninstructor after a reasonable period of time. In these circumstances, the course \\ninstructor may proceed with determination of responsibility and outcome. \\nDetermining Responsibility and Course-Level Action \\n1. \\nThe course instructor will decide whether the suspected violation(s) occurred based on \\navailable evidence. At this stage, instructors are encouraged to consult with the \\ndepartment’s designated Academic Integrity Liaison, department/program head, the \\ncollege dean’s office or the Office of Community Standards and Integrity regarding the \\nnature of the suspected violation(s), the nature of the evidence related to the alleged \\nviolation(s), and the range of outcomes under consideration. \\n2. \\nWhen assessing responsibility for an academic integrity violation, the course instructor \\nshould apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance of the \\nevidence means that the course instructor has determined that it is more likely than not \\nthat the student has violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity. \\n3. \\nIf the course instructor concludes that the student is responsible for the alleged \\nviolation(s), the course instructor should determine an outcome. The most severe \\noutcome that can be assessed at this level of review and action is course failure',\n",
       " \"119 \\n \\n \\nalthough the instructors and/or department heads may recommend additional \\noutcomes for consideration during second-level review, decision, and action. \\n4. \\nStudents who have pending or documented academic disciplinary action may not drop \\nor withdraw from the course in question. In rare circumstances, the course instructor \\nmay provide explicit approval to drop the course. Students who drop the course without \\nthe proper permission will be manually re-enrolled in the course and further outcomes \\nmay result. \\n5. \\nStudents who have pending or documented academic disciplinary action may not \\nchange a course to P/NP (including the use of a voucher) \\nDocumenting and Reporting the Course-Level Decision \\n1. \\nAfter determining responsibility and outcomes for a violation(s), the instructor should \\nimmediately and in writing via email notify the involved student(s) of the decision. If \\nfound responsible, the rationale for the determination of responsibility should be \\nincluded in that notification. The outcome(s) that the course instructor has assessed \\nshould be noted as well. Students should also be informed of the opportunity to request \\nan appeal and the procedures for doing so. \\n2. \\nAll documented violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity should be \\nreported to the Office of Community Standards and Integrity upon completion of the \\ninvestigation and student notification. Reports may be submitted using the Academic \\nIntegrity Reporting Form. \\n3. \\nA copy of the email communication to the student should be included with the report. \\nCourse instructors are also encouraged to submit all evidence and supporting \\ndocumentation. \\n4. \\nUpon receipt of the violation report, the Office of Community Standards and Integrity \\nwill notify the following individuals of the course-level decision and action: \\n• Head of the student’s home department \\n• Associate dean of the student’s home college  \\n• Academic advisor for the student \\n• Head of department in which the course is registered (if different from the student's \\ndepartment)\",\n",

All requests for appeal must be submitted in writing via email to the Office of \\nCommunity Standards and Integrity.  \\nThe written appeal request must indicate whether the student is appealing the finding of \\nresponsibility, the outcome, or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an \\nappeal will be limited to one or more of the following: \\n• A gross error in procedural process that materially affected the outcome; \\n• Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the \\ncourse-level review; \\n• Stated course-level outcome(s) of failure in the course(s) that was not commensurate with \\nthe violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student was found \\nresponsible; and \\n• New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the course-level review, \\nmerits re-consideration of the final disposition. \\nThe vice president for student affairs or designee will review the written appeal request and \\ndetermine whether, in their judgment, the appeal presents an appealable issue that warrants \\nreview by an Academic Review Board.  \\nIn the event of an appeal, outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the outcome of \\nthe appeal.\",\n",

The purpose of the hearing will be to make a \\nrecommendation to the vice provost for education or designee as to whether the course \\ninstructor’s initial decision should be upheld, vacated or modified based on a preponderance of \\nthe evidence standard.

The basis of an \\nappeal will be limited to one or more of the following cases: \\n• A gross error in procedural process that materially affected the outcome; \\n• The outcomes imposed during the second-level review were not commensurate with the \\nviolation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student was found \\nresponsible; \\n• Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the \\ncourse-level action appeal review or second-level review; \\n• New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the hearing, merits re-\\nconsideration of the final disposition. \\nThe appeal officer designated by the provost will review the written appeal request and \\ndetermine whether, in the judgment of the appeal officer, the appeal presents an appealable \\nissue that warrants review by the appeal officer. In hearing an appeal, the appeal officer, at their \\ndiscretion, may meet with individuals and review information relevant to the basis of the appeal.  \\nIn the event of an appeal, outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the outcome of \\nthe appeal. \\nAppeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances warrant.

The appeal officer may reconvene the \\ninitial Academic Review Board or remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for \\nreview. \\nOutcomes \\nThe academic disciplinary action outcomes defined below comprise a range of official actions \\nthat may be imposed during second-level review. One or more of these actions may be imposed \\nin response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, as other outcomes may be \\nimposed as appropriate. \\nNon-compliance with outcomes may result in further action through the Academic Review Board \\nprocess. \\nThe determination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of \\nthe community, the learning and development of the student, the impact of the violation(s), and \\nany mitigating or aggravating circumstances. \\nOutcomes related to student standing \\nThese outcomes clarify the student's standing with the University. Additional violations of the \\nAcademic Integrity policy may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the \\nUniversity. \\n• Disciplinary Probation: A student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a \\ndesignated period of time. Probation may entail specific requirements to be met. When a \\nstudent is on disciplinary probation, they may be subject to suspension or expulsion in \\nthe event of further academic disciplinary action. \\n• Disciplinary Suspension: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated \\nperiod of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves \\nfrom the campus (including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, \\nand libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off the \\ncampus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the University Policy on \\nStudent Suspension/Required Withdrawal.

Students who have been \\ndropped from an academic program may apply for admission to other academic \\nprograms at the university. \\n• Expulsion: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the university. \\nStudents who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from the campus \\n(including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) \\nwithin a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off of the campus \\npermanently, unless otherwise specified. Students who have been expelled from the \\nuniversity may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the university. \\n• Loss of Privilege: Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to \\nfacilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university activities. \\nRestorative Outcomes \\nThese outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior caused \\nor to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the community. \\nFailure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in additional \\nacademic disciplinary action. \\n• Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations: The university may require a student to \\nmeet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a specified \\ntime frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any relevant \\nassessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent recommendation(s), \\nsuch as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The student is also expected to \\nprovide the appropriate releases to allow the university to confirm compliance with this \\noutcome. \\n• Community Service: The university may require uncompensated service (a specified \\nnumber of hours) to the university or an off-campus, non-profit organization as an \\noutcome. The particular assignment of duties must be pre-approved by the process \\nadvisor. Students must provide appropriate documentation verifying their completed \\ncommunity service.  \\n• Educational/Developmental Assignment: The university may require a student to \\ncomplete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student’s education and \\ndevelopment. These assignments are determined by the Academic Review Board and',\n",

Assignments may include but are not \\nlimited to: reflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an \\nindividual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc. \\nWithholding a Degree \\nBecause a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic \\nrequirements but also compliance with the university’s standards and good standing as a \\nmember of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a degree \\nnot be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the resolution of \\nacademic disciplinary action proceedings, including completion of all outcomes. \\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions Retention and Reporting \\nRecords of academic disciplinary actions proceedings are confidential and are not released \\nwithout the consent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law \\nor court order. With the exceptions as noted below, records of academic disciplinary actions \\nproceedings are retained for three years after final separation of the student from the \\nuniversity. For purposes of determining final separation from the university, a student must be \\nseparated for three continuous years. If a student reenrolls in any student program within three \\nyears, the calculation of the final separation date will reset. \\nConsistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy, for purposes of academic disciplinary actions \\nrecord checks, information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization \\nas necessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as defined above) \\nprovided the student has fulfilled all obligations to the university. \\nThe file may be maintained indefinitely and reported longer than three years after the student \\nseparates from the university if a student has not fulfilled all obligations or has not resolved a \\npending Academic Integrity violation. \\nRecords of academic disciplinary actions proceedings resulting in the permanent separation of a \\nstudent from the university (e.g., expulsion) will be maintained and reported indefinitely. \\nCase-specific questions regarding timeframes for academic disciplinary actions records \\nretention and reporting can be directed to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity.',\n",

The Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy helps to \\nregulate the use of advertising space on Carnegie Mellon University\\'s Pittsburgh campus. \\nNoting the Use of Student Activities Fees \\nIf one hundred (100) percent of the budget for a student organization, activity or event is \\nfinanced by the Activities Fee, then all advertising and printed material associated with \\nthat organization, activity or event must include the phrase \"Funded by your Student \\nActivities Fee\". \\n \\nIf the Activities Fee finances a portion of the budget for a student organization, activity or \\nevent, but less than one hundred (100) percent of that budget, then all advertising and \\nprinted material associated with that organization, activity or event must include either \\nthe phrase \"Funded in part by your Student Activities Fee\", or \"Funded by your Student \\nActivities Fee\". \\nGraffiti \\nGraffiti is not a permissible form of advertising on Carnegie Mellon University\\'s campus. \\nGraffiti is defined as any defacement of Carnegie Mellon University property, the \\ndefacement of posters hung on campus bulletin boards, and/or the use of drawings or \\nmessages in a public space that are libelous in nature or violate the Carnegie Mellon \\nCode. Graffiti is distinguished from painting the fence and chalking on Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity sidewalks. Permissible forms of advertising on Carnegie Mellon University\\'s \\ncampus include chalking, painting the fence and distributing posters and banners.',\n",
       " '143 \\n \\n \\nChalking \\nChalking is only permitted on sidewalks. Chalking is not permitted in areas that are not \\ndirectly exposed to rainfall, including covered sidewalks and vertical portions of outdoor \\nstairs. Chalking of this sort is a form of graffiti. The sidewalk chalk used for chalking must \\nbe water-soluble and must be removable by the natural elements. Products such as spray \\nchalk, washable crayons, and other semi-permanent products deemed not removable by \\nthe natural elements are considered a form of graffiti. \\nPainting the Fence \\nPainting the Fence, a long standing tradition at Carnegie Mellon University, is not \\nconsidered graffiti so long as only paintbrushes are used. The use of spray paint, \\nairbrushes, paint rollers, and similar tools to paint the Fence is a form of graffiti. While \\npainting the Fence, all painting materials must be kept within the gravel area surrounding \\nthe Fence. Painting anything other than the Fence is a form of graffiti. \\nPosters \\nCarnegie Mellon University recognized groups, organizations, academic and \\nadministrative departments, and students are only permitted to post active posters on \\nthe Student Government bulletin board. Posters are not permitted on doors, walls, and/or \\nwindows at Carnegie Mellon University. Locations of permitted bulletin boards can be \\nfound on the Student Government website. Posters must meet the following criteria: \\n• The posted items do not exceed a size of 11\" x 17\"; \\n• The name and contact information of the sponsoring Carnegie Mellon University \\nrecognized group, organization, department, or member of the campus community is \\nclearly indicated on the poster, unless that poster has been registered with the Graffiti \\nand Poster Policy Administrator via the Student Senate Campus Life Committee and/or \\nthe Graduate Student Assembly Vice President of Campus Affairs; \\n• There is a maximum of one (1) active poster per event, per bulletin board location; \\n• New posters are not posted over other active posters; \\n• The posted items are removed from bulletin board locations no more than seven (7) \\ndays after they are no longer active posters. \\nBanners \\nStudent organizations are permitted to hang banners on Doherty Hall through the \\nfollowing procedure:',\n",
       " '144 \\n \\n \\n• All banners must be approved by the Office of Student Activities. \\n• Space for large banners that are hung over the entrance to Doherty Hall can be \\nreserved on a first come, first serve basis, through the Office of Student Activities. \\n• Banners posted on the outside wall of Doherty Hall must be removed within forty-eight \\n(48) hours after the event advertised on the banner. If no event is advertised, the \\nbanner must be removed no later than thirty (30) days after its initial posting on \\nDoherty Hall. \\nEnforcement Summary \\nThis policy should be reviewed in its entirety online. \\nThe Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy Administrator will monitor Student \\nGovernment bulletin boards and report any violations and/or graffiti to the appropriate \\nparties. Groups or individuals violating this policy will be notified in writing, noting if a fine \\nis being assessed and the process for appealing that fine. \\nAdvertising in the Cohon University Center \\nThose who want their poster to appear on the bulletin board location near the Cohon \\nUniversity Center Information Desk shall submit two posters per event to the Information \\nDesk. This board is maintained by Cohon University Center administration and only \\nposters submitted to the Desk will be displayed; all others will be removed. All other \\nbulletin boards in the Cohon University Center are subject to the regulations set forth by \\nthe Director of the Cohon University Center. \\nAlcohol and Drug Policy \\nI. Policy Statement \\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy community \\nthat supports the academic mission of the institution. In keeping with this commitment, \\nthe university permits the use of alcohol or drugs within its community only in a manner \\nthat is legal, responsible, and consistent with the expectations outlined in this policy. \\nFurther, the university makes available information and resources so that its community \\nmembers are positioned to assist anyone whose personal well-being may be negatively \\nimpacted due to misuse of alcohol or drugs. \\nThis policy applies to all members of the university community, including all faculty, staff \\nand students. This policy also applies to contractors, volunteers and visitors while on',\n",
       " '145 \\n \\n \\nuniversity property (whether owned or leased) or while being paid or reimbursed with \\nuniversity funds. This policy focuses on compliance with laws in the United States and the \\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. However, as a global university with operations \\nthroughout the world, Carnegie Mellon is equally committed to compliance with all \\napplicable alcohol and drug laws in all jurisdictions in which the university operates. \\nII. Policy on Illegal Drugs \\nThe unlawful manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of drugs is prohibited at \\nthe university. This prohibition applies to the unlawful possession, distribution, sale, or \\nuse of illegal narcotics, prescription drugs, and other illegal drugs. It is a violation of this \\npolicy for prescription drugs to be provided to or used by someone other than the person \\nfor whom they were prescribed. It is also a violation of this policy for prescription drugs to \\nbe used in a manner for which they were not prescribed. \\nThe university complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws. The U.S. federal \\nDrug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989 requires institutions of higher education \\nthat receive federal funds to comply with U.S. federal drug laws. Although some state and \\nlocal governments have legalized the use of various forms of marijuana, federal law \\ncontinues to prohibit the manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of marijuana. \\nAs such, in accordance with U.S. federal law, all forms of marijuana, including prescription \\nmedical marijuana, are prohibited on all university property (whether owned or leased) \\nand in connection with all university programs. \\nFaculty, staff, and student-workers are prohibited from being under the influence of any \\ndrugs (including prescription drugs) that cause impairment and impact the ability of \\nemployees to perform their jobs. University employees with a license to operate \\nspecialized vehicles or equipment (e.g., commercial driver’s license or pilot’s license) must \\nfollow all applicable rules prohibiting the use of drugs before and/or while operating the \\nvehicle/equipment. \\nIII. Policy on Alcohol \\nThe unlawful manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of alcohol is prohibited at \\nthe university. \\nAll members of the university community are expected to comply with applicable laws \\nregarding the possession, consumption, transportation, and distribution of alcohol. \\nExcept as set forth below or as otherwise prohibited by applicable departmental-level \\nrules, the lawful consumption of alcoholic beverages on university property (whether \\nowned or leased) and/or in connection with university programs by individuals of legal',\n",
       " '146 \\n \\n \\ndrinking age (21 years or older in United States) is permitted by the university. In these \\ncircumstances, however, the university expects faculty, staff, students, contractors and all \\nother visitors to conduct themselves, both individually and collectively, in a responsible \\nmanner and in compliance with this policy. \\nThe consumption of alcohol and/or the possession of open containers of alcohol are \\nprohibited (i) while outdoors on university property, (ii) while inside university facilities in \\ncommon areas, theaters, galleries, dining facilities, or other spaces that are accessible by \\nthe public, (iii) while in classrooms, labs, studios, or other instructional spaces when a \\ncourse is in session, and (iv) at all on-campus athletic facilities. However, alcohol may be \\nserved and consumed in these locations where permitted under Section IV of this policy \\nconcerning Social Host and Alcohol Event Registration.  \\nAll university employees, including faculty, staff, and student-workers, are expected to \\nobserve the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct. Faculty, staff and \\nstudent-workers who are of legal drinking age who choose to engage in the consumption \\nof alcohol are expected to do so responsibly. Faculty, staff, and student-workers are \\nprohibited from working while intoxicated or impaired. Furthermore, faculty, staff, and \\nstudent-workers are prohibited from consuming alcohol in a manner that in any way \\nimpairs the performance of job duties, endangers the physical well-being of oneself or \\nothers, or could result in the damage of property (in most circumstances, employees are \\nto refrain from consuming alcohol when performing their normal academic, \\nadministrative, technical, or professional duties). University employees with a license to \\noperate specialized vehicles or equipment (e.g., commercial driver’s license or pilot’s \\nlicense, etc.) must follow all applicable rules prohibiting the use of alcohol before and/or \\nwhile operating the vehicle/equipment. \\nSale of Alcohol \\nIn all cases, Carnegie Mellon complies with the law of the applicable jurisdiction regarding \\nthe sale of alcohol.  Under Pennsylvania law, a liquor license is required to sell \\nalcohol.  The university does not possess a liquor license.  As such, alcohol may not be \\ndirectly or indirectly sold in connection with any university program or activity in \\nPennsylvania unless the alcohol is sold and/or served by a third-party that possesses a \\nvalid liquor license and, if necessary, an off-premises catering permit.  The indirect sale of \\nalcohol includes, but is not limited to, the following: \\n• The sale of tickets, entrances fees, or required donations to attend an event where \\nalcohol is served; and',\n",
       " '147 \\n \\n \\n• The use of drink tickets in connection with paid admission to an event where alcohol is \\nserved. \\nIV. Social Host and Alcohol Event Registration \\nA “University Event with Alcohol” is a university event where alcohol will be served either \\n(1) on campus, or (2) off-campus where the alcohol is paid for directly, in whole or in part, \\nwith University funds, or where reimbursement, in whole or in part, is made for the \\npurchase of alcohol using University funds.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following \\nactivities are not University Events with Alcohol for purposes of Social Host and \\nregistration requirements (however, the other provisions of this Alcohol and Drug Policy \\nstill apply): \\ni. consumption of alcohol by students of legal drinking age in an on-campus private \\nresidence; \\nii. consumption of alcohol in an on-campus private residence that is leased, rented or \\notherwise occupied by an employee of the university, where no students are expected \\nand/or permitted to attend (excluding students who are relatives of the employee); \\niii. consumption of alcohol in a Private Office with a door and lock that is occupied by no \\nmore than four (4) faculty and/or staff members and where no students are present, \\nand \\niv. any events registered through the process that fraternities and/or sororities are \\nrequired to use in order to host an event with alcohol. \\nAs detailed in the Social Host & Alcohol Event Registration Procedures [pdf], a University \\nEvent with Alcohol must be registered with and approved in advance by the Office of the \\nDean of Students, and at least one Social Host must be designated for the University \\nEvent with Alcohol. These procedures set forth the requirements for University Events \\nwith Alcohol, the requirements for Social Hosts, and the types of events exempt from \\nthese requirements. \\nThe Social Host for each University Event with Alcohol is responsible for (1) ensuring that \\nalcohol is served only to individuals who are of legal drinking age (2) ensuring that \\nindividuals who are visibly intoxicated are not served alcohol, and (3) oversight of the \\nevent consistent with the Social Host Responsibility Guidelines set forth in the Social Host \\n& Alcohol Event Registration Procedures [pdf].',\n",
       " '148 \\n \\n \\nThe university will provide a legal defense and/or indemnity to any individual who serves \\nas a Social Host of a University Event with Alcohol, pursuant to the Social Host & Alcohol \\nEvent Registration Procedures [pdf], and subject to the attached Terms and Conditions for \\nSocial Host Defense and Indemnity [pdf]. \\nThe rights of faculty and Trustees and Officers of the University who serve as Social Hosts \\nare not governed by the Terms and Conditions for Social Host Defense and Indemnity \\n[pdf]. Rather, faculty defense and indemnity rights continue to be governed by Article VIII \\nof the University By-Laws concerning Professional Protection Regarding Faculty Members. \\nDefense and indemnity rights of Trustees and Officers of the University continue to be \\ngoverned by Article IX of the University By-Laws concerning Liability and Indemnification \\nof Trustees and Officers. \\nV. Sanctions & Medical Amnesty \\nFaculty, staff, and students who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up \\nto and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment. Visitors to the \\nuniversity who violate this policy may be removed from university property and university \\nevents. Individuals who violate this policy may also be referred for criminal prosecution, \\nthough criminal charges are not a prerequisite for sanctions under this policy. Information \\nregarding the state and federal criminal penalties for violations of drug and alcohol laws, \\nas well as information regarding the health risks associated with the use of drugs and \\nalcohol, is available in the University’s annual Alcohol and Drug Brochure [pdf]. \\nThe university community values the health and safety of its members and supports an \\nenvironment that encourages students to come to the assistance of one another.  As \\nspecified in the Active Medical Assistance Protocol students will be granted amnesty from \\nuniversity disciplinary action and University Police action when assistance from \\nemergency services personnel is appropriately sought for individuals in need of \\nimmediate medical attention due to alcohol or drug use. In the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania, similar amnesty from criminal prosecution is also available to individuals \\npursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. § 6308.1 and 35 P.S. § 780-113.7. \\nVI. Resources \\nThe university provides the following resources to individuals seeking assistance relating \\nto the abuse of alcohol or drugs.',\n",
       " \"149 \\n \\n \\n• Counseling & Psychological Services — Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is \\navailable as a resource to students for initial assessment of drug and alcohol use, and \\nreferrals to off campus outpatient and inpatient treatment programs. \\n• University Health Services — University Health Services (UHS) also provides students \\nwith initial assessment of drug and alcohol use and referrals to CaPS or off-campus \\ntreatment programs, in addition to substance abuse prevention education, through its \\nOffice of Health Promotion. Individual sessions are offered alongside online programs \\nto assist students in assessing their own usage patterns and reducing the risks \\nassociated with substance abuse. UHS also facilitates the Collegiate Recovery \\nCommunity at the university to support and connect students and their allies who are \\nchoosing sobriety. Information about appropriate community support groups is \\navailable through CaPS and UHS. Some of the support programs available in the \\nPittsburgh area include: Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Al-Anon and \\nthe Adult Children of Alcoholics Network of Greater Pittsburgh. \\n• Employee Assistance Program — Carnegie Mellon has established an Employee \\nAssistance Program (EAP), sponsored and paid for by the university, to facilitate \\nemployees' efforts to resolve problems that can affect job performance and general \\nwell-being.  EAP services include counseling and support relating to substance abuse. \\nBroadcasting \\nAll students who participate in commercial, off-campus television or radio broadcasts, \\nwebcasts or podcasts and use the Carnegie Mellon name should consult with the Media \\nRelations Department. These students should contact Media Relations at 412-268-2900 prior \\nto their participation. \\nCode of Business Ethics and Conduct Policy \\nAuthority \\nCarnegie Mellon University has various well-established policies and principles (some of \\nwhich are referenced throughout this Code of Business Ethics and Conduct) which apply \\nto different aspects of the University’s business and operations. As a result of the recent \\nenactment of various federal regulations, it has become necessary to re-state some of \\nthese various policies and principles into one Code of Business Ethics and Conduct.\",\n",
       " \"150 \\n \\n \\nApplicability \\nThis Code applies to individuals who are paid by the University when they are working for \\nthe University, including faculty, staff and students when working for the University. These \\nindividuals are referred to in this Code as “members of the University community.”[19] \\nIntroduction and Purpose \\nThe University’s mission to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research \\nand creative inquiry, teaching, and learning requires all members of the University \\ncommunity to maintain the highest ethical and professional standards in all domains. \\nAccordingly, all members of the University community are expected to honor this Code \\nwhen working for the University. \\nThis Code reflects the University’s well-established policies and principles governing the \\nbehavior of all members of the University community when working for the University, \\nand is intended to function as a useful summary of ethical principles and to emphasize \\nthe importance of observing these principles. As such, this Code draws on the ethical and \\nbehavioral standards set forth in many separate University policies and principles as well \\nas applicable laws. This Code supplements but does not supplant other applicable \\nUniversity policies and principles including, but not limited to, official University Policies, \\nthe Faculty Handbook and the Staff Handbook. \\nCode of Business Ethics and Conduct \\na) Ethical and Professional Conduct.

If \\nindividuals are to cherish freedom, they must experience it. The very concept of freedom \\nassumes that people usually choose wisely from a range of available ideas and that the \\nrange and implications of ideas cannot be fully understood unless we hold vital our rights \\nto know, to express, and to choose. The university must be a place where all ideas may be \\nexpressed freely and where no alternative is withheld from consideration. The only limits \\non these freedoms are those dictated by law and those necessary to protect the rights of \\nother members of the University community and to ensure the normal functioning of the \\nUniversity. \\nRights \\nOn Carnegie Mellon's campus, anyone may distribute printed material, offer petitions for \\nsignature, make speeches, and hold protests or demonstrations outside university \\nbuildings.

No event shall infringe upon the \\nrights or privileges of anyone not in sympathy with it, and no one will be permitted to \\nharm others, damage or deface property, block access to university buildings or disrupt \\nclasses. The enforcement of these conditions will not depend in any way on the message \\nor sponsorship of the act or event. When guests are invited by a recognized campus \\norganization, they may express their ideas not because they have a right to do so, but \\nbecause members of the campus community have a right to hear, see, and experience \\ndiverse intellectual and creative inquiry. Defending that right is a fundamental obligation \\nof the university. Controversy cannot be permitted to abridge the freedoms of speech, \\nthought, expression or assembly.

Courtesy hours exist at all other times, \\nduring which the right of residents to live in an environment free from bothersome noise \\nshould be respected. \\n\"Quiet\" is defined as being unable to hear any noise at a distance of 10 feet from a room \\nwith a closed door. During \"courtesy\" hours, noise can be considered bothersome if it can \\nbe heard at a distance of 50 feet. \\nThe notion of \"courtesy\" more broadly involves structuring your activities so that other \\npeople in your living unit are not adversely affected by noise. In particular, all residents \\nare encouraged to carefully plan their use of sound equipment (such as stereos and TVs) \\nor their social gatherings so that the noise produced by them does not infringe upon the \\nrights of others. \\nThe established quiet hours stated above are the minimums for every residential area. If \\nyou or anyone in your living unit believes that quiet hours should be extended, contact \\nyour Resident Assistant (RA) or Student Dormitory Council representative. That person \\nhas the authority to conduct a vote of the people living in your area and, pending \\nunanimous approval, extended quiet hours will be implemented. \\nIf you have concerns in relation to quiet hours or courtesy hours in your living area, please \\nfeel free to consult your RA. The RA is your primary advocate in situations involving noise \\nviolations and can assist you by addressing any questions or concerns you may have. \\nQuiet Living Areas \\nWelch and designated first-year housing areas offer quiet living, a particularly desirable \\nalternative to traditional on-campus housing for undergraduate students. This \\ndesignation provides an assurance to all residents in these buildings, and to all residents \\nin the surrounding area, that resident students will act with the highest degree of \\ncommon courtesy and respect for others in maintaining a particularly quiet and \\nunobtrusive environment. \\nThis designation includes a provision for an extension of the university’s current quiet \\nhours policy to 24 hours. As such, residents will be responsible for ensuring that the noise \\ngenerated within their apartments or residence hall room is not audible at a distance of \\nten feet from their apartment or residence hall room. Common courtesy will be expected; \\nresidents should respond to any request from a fellow resident to reduce the noise level \\nfrom their apartment or residence hall room, even if already within this guideline.  \\nThe following specific guidelines will also exist:',\n",

       " '191 \\n \\n \\nA No Contact Agreement (NCA) is a mutual agreement between two students who voluntarily \\naffirm that they will not have direct contact with each other, or make indirect contact through \\nthird parties, except for that which is necessary for their academic pursuits. An NCA does not \\nconstitute a finding of responsibility for violating university policy, nor does it preclude the \\npossibility of future review of any past interactions through the community standards \\nprocess. Following discussion and agreement to enter into the NCA, the two students will \\nreceive a letter confirming the terms of the agreement. In the event that a student declines to \\nenter into a requested NCA, an associate vice president of student affairs may elect to review \\nthe matter to determine whether a No Contact Order is warranted. Please see a sample No \\nContact Agreement (pdf). \\nA No Contact Order (NCO) is a directive from an associate vice president of student affairs \\nindicating that two students may not have direct contact with each other, or make indirect \\ncontact through third parties, except for that which is necessary for their academic pursuits. \\nAn NCO may be issued: \\n• when, upon careful review, the associate vice president deems there is sufficient \\ninformation presented that doing so will safeguard students’ abilities to pursue their \\neducation in an environment free from unwanted contact. In such an instance, the NCO \\ndoes not constitute a finding of responsibility for violating university policy, nor does it \\npreclude the possibility of future review of any past interactions through the community \\nstandards process; or \\n• in connection with the community standards process, either as an interim measure during \\nthe pendency of the process and/or an outcome associated with a finding of responsibility \\nfrom the process. \\nNo Contact Orders issued after a finding of responsibility are most often binding only on the \\nresponding party.  However, in limited circumstances, they may be mutual. Carnegie Mellon \\nwill carefully consider the individual circumstances of the situation, including the burden \\nplaced on the reporting party by issuing a mutual No Contact Order. \\nPlease see a sample No Contact Order (pdf). A student who receives an NCO may appeal the \\ndecision in writing to the dean of students (a NCO received as a sanction through the \\ncommunity standards process may be appealed via the appeal procedures set forth in the \\nCommunity Standards section of The Word). \\nOnce implemented, any violation of an NCA or an NCO will be vigorously pursued as an \\nalleged violation of community standards through the community standards process.

Acknowledging our desire to foster a vibrant campus \\nculture, which will necessarily involve some noise associated with campus activities, the \\nfollowing expectations are intended to guide thoughtful planning and decision-making by \\nstudents and student groups: \\nActivity occurring on Carnegie Mellon-owned or managed property that disrupts the normal \\ncourse of business or is otherwise disruptive to the university or surrounding communities is \\nrestricted during the following hours: \\n• Monday - Thursday: before 4:40 p.m. and after 6:50 p.m. \\n• Friday: before 4:40 p.m. and after 10:00 p.m. \\n• Saturday and Sunday: before 7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m. \\nTo fully support our vision for campus life, it is necessarily the case that some organized \\nactivities will merit consideration for exception to these articulated hours. Such requests are \\nencouraged and should be submitted via this form to the Director of Student Leadership, \\nInvolvement, and Civic Engagement for review and approval. \\nAny time that excessive noise results in a reasonable complaint from individuals within or \\nbeyond the campus, the responsible party is expected to reduce the volume immediately. \\nFailure to meet such a request from a university official will be referred for disciplinary \\nreview, separate and apart from any citations or other actions that may be taken by law \\nenforcement authorities. \\nAny individual who would like to make a complaint about excessive noise is encouraged to \\nimmediately direct it to University Police, (412) 268-2323, who will maintain a record of the \\ncomplaint in connection with their response.',\n",
       " '193 \\n \\n \\nOn-Campus Emergencies \\nUniversity Police Emergency Phone Number: (412) 268-2323 \\nIf You Discover a Fire \\n1. \\nIf you can, quickly put out the fire using a proper fire extinguisher. Report the \\nincident promptly to University Police at (412) 268-2323. \\n2. \\nIf you see that a fire cannot be quickly extinguished, activate the nearest fire alarm \\nstation and evacuate the area. \\nBasic Evacuation Instructions \\n1. \\nWhenever an alarm sounds, evacuate immediately. If you can safely close all \\nwindows in your area before leaving, do so. \\n2. \\nClose your door as you leave, making certain that you have your keys with you (heavy \\nconcentrations of smoke may make your return necessary). In dormitory buildings at \\nnight, turn the room lights on as you leave to signal your evacuation. \\n3. \\nHelp retard the spread of smoke and flames by closing fire doors behind you as you \\npass through the building. Fire doors should never be obstructed or blocked open.  \\n4. \\nMove quickly to the nearest building exit, but refrain from running. \\n5. \\nDo not attempt to use elevators for evacuation purposes. \\n6. \\nIf you encounter heavy smoke, change your exit route to the next available exit. Help \\nguide others if you appear to be more familiar with the building. \\n7. \\nAs you exit, move well away from the building exterior to assure your safety and to \\nprovide ample room for responding firefighters and emergency equipment. \\nNo one is to re-enter an evacuated building until it has been determined safe to do so by \\nthe ranking fire department officer at the scene. \\nAid to the Physically Challenged \\nBlind and mobile persons should first be moved out of the rush of traffic, and then \\npromptly assisted to the nearest exit. Deaf and mobile persons may be unaware of the \\nneed to evacuate, and should be calmly advised and guided to the nearest available exit.',\n",
       " \"194 \\n \\n \\nImmobilized persons \\nTo reduce the risk of personal injury, attempts to carry immobilized persons are \\ndiscouraged. Wherever stairs are a part of the evacuation route, the following procedures \\nare to be applied: \\n1. \\nAs soon as a fire alarm sounds, the physically impaired person is to be quickly moved \\nto reasonable safety, preferably to an enclosed room or space that smoke or flames \\ncannot easily enter. This action needs to be accompanied by a verbal explanation so \\nthat the person being assisted understands what is happening and why these actions \\nare being taken. Again, elevators cannot be used safely for evacuation purposes. \\n2. \\nIf a telephone is available, University Police (412-268-2323) should immediately be \\ncontacted and advised of the individual's name and location within the building and \\nthe phone number from which the call is being made. If alone, the disabled person \\nmay wish to remain on the phone with University Police. \\n3. \\nIf available, a companion, or other responsible person may stand by to remain with \\nand assist the physically challenged individual. \\n4. \\nUpon clearing the building, a floor marshal or other designated person from the \\nsame floor area should alert responding firefighters and/or University Police to the \\nexact location of the person or persons. If it becomes necessary for removal from the \\nbuilding, this can then be carried out by trained, equipped, emergency personnel. \\nAdditional information can be found on the Environmental Health & Safety website. \\nCMU Alert Emergency Notification Service \\nCMU-Alert is Carnegie Mellon's emergency notification service, which sends voice and/or \\ntext messages to your registered phone in the event of a campus emergency. \\nAll students are pre-registered for CMU-Alert.

Child Protection Operations will coordinate with each program or activity to \\ndevelop appropriate procedures and training to ensure the welfare and security of \\nminors who participate in the program. \\n2. \\nThe review process conducted by Child Protection Operations will be based on the \\nunique circumstances of each program and include consideration of the following \\nkey factors, among others: the nature of the program; the duration of the program; \\nthe entity sponsoring the program; the responsible individual(s); the number of \\nparticipants and age ranges; the number of supervising adults; the facilities to be \\nused; use of overnight accommodations; potential health and safety concerns (e.g., \\nlaboratory use, machinery, swimming pools, motor vehicles); transportation; \\nprotocols for accidents, injuries and emergencies; health and wellness plans; \\nprotocols for drop-off and pick-up; and one-on-one private interactions with minors. \\n3. \\nWritten permission must be obtained from each minor's parent/guardian prior to the \\nminor's participation in any program administered by Carnegie Mellon and/or any \\nprogram administered by a third party on Carnegie Mellon property. \\n4. \\nEach program must identify a responsible individual who will be responsible for the \\nadministration of the program and compliance with this policy. Notwithstanding the \\nrequirements of and/or exceptions to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law \\nor similar laws of other jurisdictions, the responsible individual must have valid \\nbackground certifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or \\nsimilar laws of the applicable jurisdiction. \\n5. \\nIn addition to background certifications required by law as described in Section III \\nbelow, each program must ensure that at least one individual who has received\",\n",
       " '207 \\n \\n \\ncertifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law and appropriate \\ntraining is on site during the program or activity. That is, even if applicable law does \\nnot require any individual in a program to obtain background certifications, at least \\none individual on site during the program or activity must have a background \\ncertification and appropriate training. \\n6. \\nThe college, department, unit, or student organization sponsoring the program may \\nadopt background certification standards more stringent than the minimum required \\nby law, such that any individuals participating in a program may be required to \\nobtain background certifications even where such certification is not required by the \\nPennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or other applicable laws. \\nIII. Background Certification \\nAll faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers must satisfy the background \\ncertification requirements for interacting with minors in the applicable jurisdiction. \\nSpecifically, it is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to comply with the background \\ncertification provisions of the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (23 Pa C.S.A. § \\n6303 et. seq.), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153 of 2014. Detailed information \\nregarding the requirements of and exceptions to the Pennsylvania Child Protective \\nServices Law is available on the Human Resources website.[22] \\nThese background certification requirements are separate from the program registration \\nrequirements set forth in Section II. Even though a position, activity, or program does not \\nmeet the definition of program or activity involving minors requiring registration under \\nSection II, the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (or similar laws in other \\njurisdictions) may still require background certifications.  \\nAs noted above, the University Registrar’s Office monitors non-degree students who are \\nminor children and such students are only permitted to register for an undergraduate or \\ngraduate class if the instructor, in his/her sole discretion, is willing and able to obtain \\nappropriate background certifications under Pennsylvania law. \\n \\n22 The Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, requires any University employee \\nwho has Direct Contact (as that term is defined under the CPSL) with children under the age of 18 to obtain certain background \\ncertifications. However, the CPSL does not apply to University employees whose only interactions with children under the age of \\n18 are limited to matriculated students and/or visiting prospective students. As such, most employees of Carnegie Mellon are not \\nrequired to obtain background certifications in order to perform their job duties. But if an employee’s duties include direct \\ncontact with children under the age of 18 who are not matriculated students or visiting prospective students, the employee may \\nbe required to obtain background certifications under the CPSL. For more information see https://www.cmu.edu/hr/career/new-\\nemployees/first-day/act-153.html.',\n",
       " '208 \\n \\n \\nEvery employee and volunteer who is subject to the background certification \\nrequirements of this section has an obligation to notify the university if he/she is arrested \\nfor, or convicted of, any offense prohibited by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services \\nLaw. Notice of arrests or convictions must be provided within 72 hours. Notice should be \\nsubmitted to Child Protection Clearances within the Office of Human Resources. \\nIf the university receives notice of an arrest or conviction for a prohibited offense or has \\nreasonable cause to believe that an employee or volunteer has been arrested or \\nconvicted of a prohibited offense, the university will require the employee or volunteer to \\nimmediately obtain new background certifications. In such cases, the university may \\nprohibit the individual from working with minor children pending receipt of new \\nbackground certification.  \\nIV. Mandatory Reporting \\nUnder the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law all school employees are mandatory \\nreporters of child abuse. Volunteers who are responsible for the welfare of a minor or \\nwho have direct contact with minors are also Mandatory Reporters.  \\nReports of child abuse must be immediately submitted to both: \\na) The Pennsylvania Department of Human Resources. Reports may be submitted: \\na. Orally via the Child Hotline at 1-800-932-0313; or \\nb. Electronically via the website https://www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis/public/home. \\nb) Carnegie Mellon University Officials. Reports may be submitted to: \\na. Your supervisor, or \\nb. University Police, or \\nc. Office of General Counsel \\nBy law a mandatory report must be immediately filed if there is reasonable cause to \\nsuspect that a minor is the victim of child abuse in the following circumstances: \\n• The Mandatory Reporter comes into contact with the minor in the course of \\nemployment, occupation and practice of a profession or through a regularly scheduled \\nprogram, activity, or service; \\n• The Mandatory Reporter is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance, or \\ntraining of the minor, or is affiliated with an agency, institution, organization, school, \\nregularly established church or religious organization or other entity that is directly \\nresponsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of a minor;',\n",
       " '209 \\n \\n \\n• A person makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory Reporter that an identifiable \\nminor is the victim of child abuse; \\n• An individual 14 years of age or older makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory \\nReporter that the individual has committed child abuse. \\nMembers of the university community located outside of the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania are expected to comply with any mandatory reporting laws of the applicable \\njurisdiction. Questions regarding mandatory reporting requirements in other jurisdictions \\nshould be submitted to the Office of the General Counsel.  \\nAdditional information about mandatory reporting laws in Pennsylvania as well as other \\njurisdictions is available at https://www.cmu.edu/ogc/Guidance/act_153/. \\nPrematriculation Immunization Policy \\nPolicy Rationale \\nThe university values personal and community health and recognizes the critical role that \\neach individual plays in contributing to community health by participating in personal \\nhealth care practices that prevent the spread of contagious diseases. Participation in a \\nvaccination program represents one such highly effective personal health practice. \\nVaccine-preventable diseases pose a significant threat to the public health of the campus \\ncommunity, impose a significant cost to infected individuals in terms of mortality and \\nmorbidity and impose a cost to other community members by disrupting university life \\nand academic activities.  Therefore, the university expects that all individuals will value the \\nimportance of protecting themselves and others by obtaining vaccinations against \\nvaccine-preventable diseases and acknowledges the institution’s role in supporting public \\nhealth by monitoring the vaccination status of incoming students through its policy on \\nimmunization requirements. \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe goal of the university is to provide adequate protection of the campus community \\nagainst vaccine-preventable diseases. This goal can best be achieved through a \\nprematriculation immunization requirement that is administered by University Health \\nServices (UHS). All students are required to comply with the immunization requirements \\nand the screening protocol for tuberculosis.',\n",
       " '210 \\n \\n \\nImplementation Guidelines \\nImmunization Requirements for Students \\n• Required vaccinations shall be determined by UHS and shall be consistent with \\nPennsylvania State Law and informed by the recommendations of the American \\nCollege Health Association and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. \\n• Vaccination requirements will be reviewed annually by UHS.  Any changes in the \\nrequirements effective  in the upcoming school year will be communicated to \\nincoming students and the university community in the spring term prior to \\nimplementation that fall. \\n• Application or modification of this policy for non-Pittsburgh locations will be \\ndetermined by the Director of University Health Services, in consultation with \\nrelevant colleagues in those locations. \\nAdditional Requirements for Students Residing in University Housing \\n• Because vaccine preventable diseases spread more readily in a residential \\nenvironment, UHS may set additional requirements for students who elect to live in \\nuniversity housing.  \\nRequest for Waiver \\n• A student may request a waiver from any vaccination for medical reasons or if \\nvaccination conflicts with personal or religious beliefs by contacting UHS. If an \\noutbreak of contagious disease occurs, the university reserves the right to ask \\nstudents who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until \\nthe outbreak is over. \\nScreening Protocol for Tuberculosis \\n• Students with an increased risk of exposure to tuberculosis are expected to comply \\nwith screening requirements as set forth by UHS and informed by recommendations \\nof the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control.  \\nPenalty for Noncompliance \\n• If a student fails to comply with the immunization policy, UHS will notify the University \\nRegistrar who will change the student’s enrollment status to reflect that the student is not \\nenrolled until the requirements are met.',\n",
       " '211 \\n \\n \\n• Additionally, if the student is a resident in university housing and fails to comply with the \\nimmunization requirements, he/she will be removed from housing. A fee may be assessed \\nby Housing for reactivation of the room key if the student later complies with the policy. \\nRelated Policies and Procedures \\nThe university complies with OSHA regulations regarding occupational exposure to blood-\\nborne pathogens. Questions regarding these regulations should be directed to \\nEnvironmental Health & Safety, 412-268-8182. \\nPublic Art Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nPublic Art is permanent or long-term art in public spaces on campus. This policy \\naddresses the review, acquisition, acceptance, siting, and deaccessioning of public \\nart.  Accepted public art becomes the management responsibility of the Department of \\nCampus Design and Facility Development in the Office of the Vice President for Finance \\nand the Chief Financial Officer.  \\nArt enhances the quality of life for all people and should be a part of the daily life of the \\nstudents, faculty, and staff at Carnegie Mellon.  Carnegie Mellon is a leader in education \\nfor the arts and creative research and practice, and art on the campus and in public \\nbuilding spaces should reflect this leadership status. Acquired public art should expand \\nthe educational mission of the university and the College of Fine Arts by providing \\ninteresting and challenging work of high quality, accompanied by an interpretive program \\nto make the works accessible to the non-specialist. \\nThe Public Art Committee (PAC) is established to: \\n1. \\nReview specific proposals for public art with the purpose of recommending to the \\npresident approval, suggestions for modification, or rejection of the public art, and its \\nsiting.  \\n2. \\nClarify the need for public art on the Carnegie Mellon campus and target specific \\nsiting opportunities, including both indoor and outdoor public spaces.  This work \\nbuilds on the campus master planning process. \\nPublic art is acquired through donations, solicitations, purchases, and loans.  It should be \\nrecognized that the advocacy and selection of public art can be controversial and, at \\ntimes, technically difficult.  Public art selection must address such issues as: artistic',\n",
       " \"212 \\n \\n \\nquality, appropriateness, site context, public sensibility, durability, maintainability, safety \\nand cost. \\nGiven the world class stature of our College of Fine Arts and many of its graduates, the \\nuniversity would be particularly pleased to have the opportunity to consider works by \\nprominent alumni and faculty to celebrate their leadership contribution to their discipline \\nand the world of art. \\nAs the university's financial strength becomes more robust and such funds become \\navailable, it is the university's aspiration that major new campus facilities projects will \\nallocate a percentage of project funds for the acquisition, commission and/or integration \\nof public art that will enhance the contribution of the new facility to the quality of campus \\nlife. If acquisition funding can be raised, consideration must also be given to maintenance \\nand the future maintenance of the art endowed. \\nDefinition \\nPublic Art at Carnegie Mellon is considered to be permanent or long-term art in public \\nspaces on campus, including all outdoor campus space and interior public spaces such as \\nlobbies, social spaces, etc.  The PAC does not presume any authority over works of art, \\nphotographs, etc. that faculty and staff place on view in their offices or that departments \\ninstall in their offices and teaching spaces.  Art is considered permanent if it is installed \\nwith no anticipated time limit or duration.  This policy does not address student or faculty \\nart installations with a defined time limit, and which are covered by separate guidelines \\nand coordinated by the College of Fine Arts.  \\nProcess \\nThe Public Art Committee is advisory to the president and all proposed public art and its \\nproposed site must be reviewed by the Public Art Committee and approved by the \\npresident and the Property and Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees before it is \\naccepted by the university.  The PAC meets on an ad hoc basis as public art proposals \\nrequire review, or to address other public art planning issues.  Recommendations of the \\nPAC shall be upon a vote of the majority of members convened.  The Design Review \\nCommittee must be consulted on proposals for outdoor sites that require integration into \\nthe campus master plan. \\nIn order to ensure that the PAC has the opportunity to receive input from all campus \\nconstituencies, prior to recommending acceptance of a piece of public art the PAC shall \\nhold at least one public meeting which all interested members may attend for purposes of \\nhearing about and offering comment on the proposed piece.  Representatives of the \\nprimary user(s) of the space where the public art is to be sited must also be consulted.\",\n",
       " '213 \\n \\n \\nCarnegie Mellon welcomes temporary installations in public spaces organized by \\ndepartments or individuals. There is no need for the PAC to monitor short exhibits (six \\nweeks or less). Exhibits of the Miller Gallery are also exempted from review by the PAC. \\nPublic Art Committee Membership \\nThe PAC is chaired by the dean of the College of Fine Arts.  An appropriate staff member \\ndesignated by the provost shall provide administrative support. The PAC is made up of \\ncampus representatives who provide necessary judgmental and technical \\nexpertise.

The PAC may call on others in the campus \\ncommunity or outside consultants for their technical expertise as approved by the \\nProvost. \\nCriteria for Acceptance/Rejection of Public Art \\nThe PAC will use the following criteria in considering gifts or purchases of public art: \\n• Proposed art shall display a high level of artistic quality and craftsmanship that \\nsupports and enhances the academic and creative missions of Carnegie Mellon. \\nDistinctive works of art chosen or created for campus public space shall be of \\nsufficiently high quality to merit inclusion into Carnegie Mellon\\'s permanent collection. \\n• The \"message\" of proposed art, if any, shall be acceptable to current standards and \\npolicies of the Carnegie Mellon community. \\n• An appropriate site in campus public space shall be available. \\n• Proposed art shall be structurally sound and present no environmental or safety \\nhazard. \\n• An external funding source to cover all costs of acquisition, purchase, shipping, \\ninstallation, wall-to-wall insurance, appraisal, and maintenance shall be determined \\nprior to acceptance. If sufficient funding is not immediately available, this criterion may \\nbe waived in exceptional circumstances by the president. \\n• The donor\\'s clear title to donated art and authenticity of the work shall be confirmed \\nprior to acceptance. \\nOwnership and Deaccessioning \\nOwnership and acquisition terms will be determined by the standard gift agreement \\nbetween the university and the donor of public art.  The university, with the approval of \\nthe PAC, reserves the right to sell or donate works of public art.',\n",
       " '216 \\n \\n \\nCriteria for Deaccessioning \\nThe PAC may consider the deaccessioning of artwork for one or more of the following \\nreasons in the event that it cannot be resited: \\n1. \\nA work is not, or is only rarely, on display because of lack of a suitable site. \\n2. \\nThe condition or security of the artwork cannot be reasonably guaranteed. \\n3. \\nThe artwork has been damaged or has deteriorated and repair is impractical or \\nunfeasible. \\n4. \\nThe artwork endangers public safety. \\n5. \\nIn the case of site specific artwork, the artwork’s relationship to the site is altered \\nbecause of changes to the site. \\n6. \\nThe artwork has been determined to be incompatible within the context of the \\ncollection. \\n7. \\nThe university, with the concurrence of the PAC, wishes to replace the artwork with \\nwork of more significance by the same artist. \\n8. \\nThe artwork requires excessive maintenance or has faults of design or workmanship. \\nPublications \\nPublications produced independently by students must clearly state that they do not carry \\nthe endorsement of Carnegie Mellon University. All university-sanctioned student \\npublications must be approved by the Office of the Dean of Students, and they should \\ninclude the official CMU wordmark and Statement of Assurance. Visit the brand guidelines for \\nmore information. \\nRecycling Policy \\nThis is to announce the adoption of the following Recycling Policy for the university. \\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to recycling the materials it uses and to minimizing \\nnon-hazardous waste. It is the responsibility of every member of the campus community to \\nsupport these efforts that will protect our environment by conserving resources and \\npreserving rapidly diminishing landfill space. The implementation of a campus-wide recycling \\nprogram is the first step toward developing a comprehensive environmental policy for \\nCarnegie Mellon. Recycling is just one part of a much larger program of activities through \\nwhich Carnegie Mellon will take an increasingly active role to further understanding and \\npreservation of our environment in the years to come.',\n",
       " \"217 \\n \\n \\nFacilities Management Services is responsible for the implementation of Carnegie Mellon's \\nrecycling program. The Environmental Coordinator in this department will be responsible for \\nthe management of the recycling program and coordination of waste reduction efforts on \\ncampus. Each department will designate, in writing, an official Recycling Liaison who will \\ncoordinate departmental recycling efforts with the Carnegie Mellon Environmental \\nCoordinator. \\nThe entire campus community is expected to actively participate in Carnegie Mellon's \\nRecycling Program and waste reduction efforts. This involves three distinct activities. \\n1. \\nRecycling of paper, cardboard and beverage cans (aluminum and bimetal). \\n2. \\nSource Reduction: This includes but is not limited to making double-sided copies, \\nincreased use of electronic mail instead of memos, reuse/resale of surplus furniture, etc. \\n3. \\nPurchasing products made from recycled materials. The long-term success of recycling \\nprograms in this country depends on the creation of markets for recycled materials. All \\ndepartments should purchase recycled products wherever economically feasible. \\nRecycling programs already functioning on campus are encouraged to continue and expand \\nprovided that they do not hinder the campus-wide recycling program. Individuals responsible \\nfor such programs must provide recycling volume data to the Carnegie Mellon University \\nEnvironmental Coordinator to permit the university to comply with Pennsylvania Act 101 \\n(Pennsylvania Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 101 of 1988). \\nSafety Intervention Protocol \\nCarnegie Mellon is committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for students, \\nfaculty, staff and visitors and may intervene in circumstances that seriously affect the health \\nor well-being of any student, where physical safety is seriously threatened, or where the \\noperations of the university are seriously disrupted. In keeping with this commitment, this \\nprotocol describes the procedures for assessing potential risk presented by students and \\ninterventions the university may enact. \\nIf safety is an immediate concern, an associate vice president of student affairs (or their \\ndesignee), may determine the need to issue a mandate that: \\n1. specifies the conditions for a student to maintain (or resume) her/his status as an enrolled \\nstudent; and/or: \\n2. requires a student to absent herself/himself from campus until specified conditions have \\nbeen satisfactorily engaged or completed.\",\n",
       " '218 \\n \\n \\nAny and all conditions of a mandate will be specified in a written letter from the associate \\nvice president of student affairs to the student.

The primary considerations in making this assessment will be the \\nseverity of the safety risk presented by the student, the impact of the student’s behaviors on \\nthe university community and the broader community, the student’s willingness or \\nunwillingness to voluntarily engage in a level of care that is clinically indicated; and whether \\nreasonable modifications of the university’s polices, practices or procedures significantly \\nmitigate the risk.  Should a mandate be deemed appropriate, the university will identify the \\nstudent affairs staff member(s) who will support and assist the student in meeting specific \\nrequirements and associated timelines for completion, which will be outlined in writing by \\nthe associate vice president of student affairs. If necessary, the student may be placed on an \\nadministrative leave of absence while completing these requirements.',\n",
       " '219 \\n \\n \\nA student who receives a mandate under this protocol may appeal the decision in writing to \\nthe dean of students. In connection with an appeal, a student may submit whatever \\nadditional evidence the student believes may be relevant to the decision. \\nSafety Hazards \\nThe occupation, alteration, or use of university facilities that creates a fire or safety hazard \\n(potential or actual), creates danger to individuals or others, or creates a threat to university \\nproperty is a violation of university regulations and the individual responsible is subject to \\nappropriate disciplinary action. \\nNo use of explosive or incendiary materials on university property in connection with \\nprograms or activities may take place without the explicit permission of the dean of students \\nand the director of environmental health and safety or their designated representatives. \\nFailure to abide by this regulation will result in suspension of social and competitive \\nprivileges of the organization and/or individual violating the regulation. \\nScheduling of University Facilities \\nScheduling of Space \\nAny Student Senate recognized organization is entitled to reserve available meeting space \\non the campus without rental fee. Charges for special services may be made if deemed \\nnecessary. Any student organization holding a function, dance, or social event in the \\nCohon University Center with 100 or more people in attendance must employ a campus \\npolice officer for the event. If there are more than 200 people in attendance two officers \\nmust be present. The following procedures should be followed in making requests for \\nspace and special services: \\n1. \\nRequests for space should be made through the online space request system \\nthrough the Cohon University Center. \\n2. \\nArrangements for food service should be made by calling Dining Services at 412-268-\\n2129 or email. \\n3. \\nArrangements for media technology needs should be made by calling 412-268-8855 \\nor email.',\n",

The \\nmere presence of Carnegie Mellon students and/or faculty in the general membership or \\neven in positions of leadership of an organization does not make it a university \\norganization, nor does the fact that the request for facilities is made either by a faculty \\nmember or a student. Where student organizations “sponsor” non-university \\norganizations as defined above, the request will be treated as if the non-university \\norganization itself had made the request. \\nNon-university organizations may be allowed to use Carnegie Mellon facilities under the \\nfollowing conditions: \\n1. \\nThey are organized primarily for professional or educational purposes. \\n2. \\nThe request for facilities is submitted in writing at least 30 days prior to the event. \\n3. \\nThe presence of the function on campus will not interfere with the normal activities \\nof the university. \\n4. \\nWhere there is a question in the mind of the authorizing officer about the \\nappropriateness of the request, it will be referred immediately to the dean of \\nstudents and the appropriate campus administrators. \\n5. \\nWhen a university group requests facilities for a meeting at which substantial off-\\ncampus attendance would be expected and notice of the meeting would be \\ndisseminated beyond the campus, the request must be reviewed with the dean of \\nstudents and the appropriate campus administrators. \\n6. \\nIf an event is to be approved that will substantially reduce the facilities available for \\nstudent use during periods when students are in residence, the request will be \\ndiscussed with the Student Government before final approval is given. \\n7. \\nAll requests for the use of Carnegie Mellon facilities by non-university organizations \\nshall be made originally with the Office of Conference and Event Services at 412-268-\\n1125 or via email.

Prohibited Conduct meets the definition of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\nwhen:  \\no A Faculty member or Staff member conditions the provision of an aid, a benefit, \\nor a service on another Faculty member, Staff member, Student, or third party’s \\nparticipation in unwelcome sexual conduct (commonly known as Quid Pro Quo); \\no A Faculty member, Staff member, Student or third party engages in unwelcome \\nconduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive \\nthat it effectively denies another person equal access to the University’s Programs \\nor Activities (commonly known as Sexual Harassment); or \\no A Faculty member, Staff member, Student or third party engages in Sexual \\nAssault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence or Stalking. \\n• \\nAlleged conduct is Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (though it may still be Prohibited \\nConduct) only if: \\no The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and \\no The conduct took place within the University’s Programs or Activities. \\n• \\nConduct that does not meet this strict definition for Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct is still prohibited by this Policy if it otherwise constitutes Prohibited \\nConduct (also referred to as “Other Prohibited Conduct”). \\nFaculty, Staff, Students, or third parties who violate this Policy may face, as appropriate, \\ndisciplinary action up to and including termination, expulsion, or other actions.',\n",
       " \"223 \\n \\n \\nNothing in this Policy shall be construed to abridge the free expression of ideas that is \\nessential to the university’s mission. The discourse conducted in accordance with the \\nuniversity's Freedom of Expression Policy and with the statement on Academic Freedom \\nand Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment and Tenure Policy, whether in written, \\nspoken, or electronic forms, shall be consistent with this Policy. \\nThis Policy is intended to meet the university’s obligations under Title VII of the Civil Rights \\nAct of 1964 (“Title VII”); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”); the \\nJeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (“Clery \\nAct”), as amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (“VAWA”), \\nwith respect to its application to sexual misconduct; and other applicable law and \\nregulations. \\nII. Jurisdiction \\nThis Policy applies to Faculty, Staff, Students, and third parties. This Policy covers acts of \\nProhibited Conduct committed by or against Students, Faculty, Staff, and third parties \\nwhen the Prohibited Conduct occurs: \\n• \\nIn a University Program or Activity, including, but not limited to,  \\no conduct that occurs on a university campus or other property owned or \\ncontrolled by the university; \\no in the context of university employment; or \\no in the context of university-sponsored study abroad, research, field work, practice, \\nor internship programs; or \\n• \\nOutside of a University Program or Activity,  \\no but poses a serious threat of harm, \\no has a continuing adverse effect on, or impedes equal access to educational \\nprograms or activities, or \\no creates a hostile environment for Students, Faculty, Staff, or third parties. \\nThe university retains discretion to determine whether out-of-program conduct is within \\nits jurisdiction. In making this determination, including off-campus or online conduct that \\nis not part of a University Program or Activity, the university will consider the severity of \\nthe alleged conduct, the risk of ongoing harm, whether both parties are members of the \\nUniversity Community, impact on University Programs or Activities, and whether off-\\ncampus conduct is part of a series of actions that occurred both on and off campus.\",\n",
       " '224 \\n \\n \\nThis Policy supersedes any conflicting information in any other university policies with \\nrespect to the definitions or procedures relating to Prohibited Conduct. \\nIII. Prohibited Conduct \\nProhibited Conduct under this Policy includes the following specifically defined forms of \\nbehavior: Sexual Assault, Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Harassment, Stalking, Dating \\nViolence, Domestic Violence, Retaliation, and Violation of Protective Measures. Whether \\nsomeone has engaged in Prohibited Conduct under this Policy will be assessed under a \\nReasonable Person standard. \\nSome Prohibited Conduct, like certain sex based crimes, unwelcome conduct that is \\nsufficiently severe and pervasive, and conduct that conditions an aid or benefit on \\nunwelcome sexual activity, may also constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct. \\nSome forms of conduct which may be considered inappropriate or unacceptable within \\nthe Carnegie Mellon community, such as incivility or bullying, may not meet the definition \\nof Prohibited Conduct under this Policy. However, the university retains discretion to \\nreport the conduct to an internal university department or authority such as Human \\nResources, Office of Community Standards and Integrity, or relevant academic \\ndepartment or dean to determine and implement appropriate responsive action, \\nincluding review for possible misconduct under other university policies. \\nIV. Reporting \\nThe university strives to create an environment where all members of the Carnegie Mellon \\ncommunity are aware of options for informing the university about instances of \\nsuspected Prohibited Conduct, how to seek assistance and support, and how to pursue \\nuniversity action for their own protection and that of the entire campus community. This \\nPolicy distinguishes the action of reporting from filing a Formal Complaint. Thus, \\ninformation shared about suspected Prohibited Conduct does not automatically trigger \\nformal action or an investigation, as discussed below in Section VI.B. This section outlines \\nthe mechanisms for reporting and how the university will respond to information it \\nreceives. \\nSome forms of Prohibited Conduct may also constitute crimes. The university also \\nstrongly encourages any individual who experiences, witnesses, or learns of possible \\ncriminal conduct to report them to the University Police Department or local law \\nenforcement. Prompt reporting allows law enforcement to collect and preserve evidence. \\n• To report in person:',\n",

Individuals who report Prohibited Conduct in Pennsylvania will also be informed \\nof their rights as a victim of a crime under Pennsylvania law. \\nA. How to Make a Report \\nAny individual, including Complainants, Students, Faculty, Staff, or third parties are \\nencouraged to submit reports of suspected Prohibited Conduct directly to the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX in-person, via email, phone call, or online. Reports can also be \\nmade to the university officials listed in Section VIII who are designated with the authority to \\ninstitute corrective measures. \\nThe university encourages all members of the Carnegie Mellon community to report to the \\nTitle IX Coordinator any information they learn about Prohibited Conduct. Sharing \\ninformation of concern enables the university to offer support to impacted parties and \\nprotects the community from continuance of the alleged misconduct. Third parties should \\nnote that a report about possible Prohibited Conduct, including Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct, does not alone trigger a formal resolution process. Instead, as further explained',\n",
       " '226 \\n \\n \\nin Section VI.A, a Formal Complaint must be filed in order for the formal investigation and \\nresolution process to commence. \\nCertain employees identified as Responsible Employees must report information to the Title \\nIX Coordinator so that the university can offer support and resolution options to the \\nComplainant. These individuals are listed in Section VIII along with additional information \\nregarding their obligations. \\nUpon receipt of a report, the university will promptly contact the Complainant to discuss \\nappropriate Supportive Measures (see Section V.A) and to explain the process for filing \\na Formal Complaint (see Section VI.A). Complainants are not obligated to respond to \\noutreach from the university and the university will respect this decision, with limited \\nexceptions where it is obligated by law or to act in the safety interest of the community. \\nB. Anonymous Reporting \\nAn individual who is not a Responsible Employee may make a report of Prohibited Conduct to \\nthe Title IX Coordinator, and if preferred, may do so without disclosing one’s name using the \\nonline reporting form listed above and here: \\n• cmu.ethicspoint.com \\nDepending on the level of information available about the incident or the individuals \\ninvolved, the university’s ability to respond to an anonymous report may be limited. The \\nuniversity will, however, take whatever steps it deems appropriate and in the best interests \\nof the overall University Community, consistent with the information available. The university \\nwill never refuse to respond a report solely on the grounds that it was made anonymously. \\nInformation collected through the anonymous reporting line will be shared only with \\nnecessary university officials in order to respond to the reported concern. Information is kept \\nconfidential and no personally identifiable information is shared, except as necessary to \\nfollow this Policy, without the party’s consent. \\nC.

Supportive Measures \\nThe university is committed to helping Complainants continue their education and \\nemployment after experiencing Prohibited Conduct. Regardless of whether a person \\nchooses to pursue an investigation, alternative resolution, a formal resolution, or chooses \\nnot to pursue any further process, the Title IX Coordinator or a designated university \\nofficial conducts an initial assessment to determine next steps and will initiate contact to \\ndiscuss the availability of Supportive Measures. \\nSupportive Measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services, \\naccommodations, and other assistance that the university offers and may put in place, \\nwithout fee or charge, after receiving notice of possible Prohibited Conduct. Supportive \\nMeasures are designed to restore or preserve access to the University’s Programs and \\nActivities, protect the safety of all parties and the university’s educational environment, or \\ndeter Prohibited Conduct, while not being punitive in nature or unreasonably burdening \\neither party. \\nSupportive Measures are available regardless of whether the matter is reported to the \\nuniversity for the purpose of initiating a formal resolution under this Policy and before, \\nafter, and regardless of whether a Formal Complaint is filed. A Complainant who requests \\nSupportive Measures retains the right to file a Formal Complaint, either at the time the \\nSupportive Measure is offered or requested or at a later date. Any Complainant that \\nrequests Supportive Measures will be informed in writing of their right to simultaneously \\nor subsequently file a Formal Complaint pursuant to this Policy. \\nUpon receipt of a report, the Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will contact \\nthe Complainant (1) to discuss the availability of Supportive Measures and (2) to explain \\nthat Supportive Measures are available with or without the filing of a Formal Complaint. \\nThe Title IX Case Manager helps determine the appropriate Supportive Measure(s) to be \\nimplemented. The Title IX Case Manager will assess with the Complainant the unique facts \\nand circumstances of their situation and identify steps to help the individual meet their \\neducational or employment expectations. The Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will \\nserve as the point of contact for implementing any identified measures to ensure the \\nburden of implementation does not fall on the recipient of the Supportive Measures.',\n",
       " \"228 \\n \\n \\nSupportive Measures will not be disciplinary or punitive in nature and will not \\nunreasonably burden, or unreasonably interfere with the educational pursuits of, either \\nparty. Whether a possible Supportive Measure would unreasonably burden either party is \\na fact-specific determination that takes into account the nature of the educational \\nprograms, activities, opportunities and benefits in which an individual is participating. \\nSupportive Measures may also be requested by and made equally available \\nto Respondents, witnesses, and other impacted members of the University Community. \\nExamples of Supportive Measures include: \\n• Academic support services and accommodations, including the ability to reschedule \\nclasses, exams and assignments, transfer course sections, or withdraw from courses; \\n• Academic schedule modifications (typically to separate Complainant and Respondent); \\n• Work schedule or job assignment modifications (for university employment); \\n• Changes in on-campus work or university housing location; \\n• On-campus counseling services and/or assistance in connecting to community-based \\ncounseling services; \\n• Assistance in connecting to community-based medical services; \\n• No contact agreements (agreements between parties to stop all attempts at \\ncommunication or other interaction with one another); \\n• Temporarily limiting an individual's access to certain university facilities or activities; \\n• Work schedule or job assignment modifications; \\n• Information about and/or assistance with obtaining personal protection orders; \\n• Leaves of absences; \\n• Increased monitoring and security of certain areas of the campus; \\n• Individualized limitations on the parties’ communications and interactions with each \\nother; or \\n• A combination of any of these measures. \\nThe university will maintain Supportive Measures provided to \\nthe Complainant or Respondent as confidential to the extent that maintaining such \\nconfidentiality would not impair the university’s ability to provide the Supportive \\nMeasures.\",\n",
       " \"229 \\n \\n \\nB. Support and Resources \\nAll members of the Carnegie Mellon community may seek support and access resources \\non and off-campus that are available at no cost. The Office for Institutional Equity and \\nTitle IX can assist individuals in accessing these resources or individuals may contact the \\ndepartments or organizations directly. \\nSome of these resources are designated as confidential. Other resources provide support, \\nbut may need to involve the Title IX Coordinator and/or the University Police Department. \\nRegardless of whether the university determines that Prohibited Conduct occurred, the \\nuniversity will offer resources or assistance to Complainants, Respondents, witnesses, and \\nother impacted community members after receiving notice of alleged Prohibited Conduct. \\nThe university will also assist those individuals in identifying and contacting external law \\nenforcement agencies and community resources, when desired by the individual. \\n1. Confidential Resources \\nCarnegie Mellon understands that some individuals impacted by Prohibited Conduct, \\nparticularly conduct involving sexual violence, may not be ready or may not be willing \\nto report through a channel that may lead to an investigation or other university \\naction, no matter how discreet. For such individuals, Carnegie Mellon maintains several \\nconfidential reporting options. \\nThese resources can provide individuals with assistance, support, and additional \\ninformation. Confidential Resources are prohibited from disclosing confidential \\ninformation unless (1) given permission by the person who disclosed the information; \\n(2) there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others; (3) the conduct involves \\nsuspected abuse of a minor under the age of 18; or (4) as otherwise required or \\npermitted by law or court order.

Filing a Formal Complaint \\nA Complainant who chooses to pursue an alternative or formal resolution to address any \\nreported Prohibited Conduct must begin by filing a Formal Complaint with the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX. Filing a Formal Complaint will initiate an investigation \\npursuant to the university’s process outlined in Section VI.B below. The university will not \\ncommence a formal investigation or its resolution process without the Complainant or the \\nTitle IX Coordinator filing a Formal Complaint. \\nA Complainant may file a Formal Complaint with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, \\nor by email with submission of a Formal Complaint Form. The Formal Complaint must \\ncontain the Complainant’s physical or digital signature or otherwise indicate that \\nthe Complainant is the person filing (if the Complainant is under the age of 18 and not \\nenrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program, the University will ordinarily also contact \\nthe Complainant’s parent or guardian, as permitted by law, to explain the process for filing \\na Formal Complaint). A Complainant may file a Formal Complaint at any time, but significant \\ndelays between the time an incident occurs and conducting an investigation may impede or \\nlimit the availability of relevant material and/or availability of witnesses. \\nIn certain circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator may file a Formal Complaint. Whether \\nthe university will begin an investigation in response to a report under these \\ncircumstances depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to the wishes of \\nthe Complainant, the nature and scope of the alleged Prohibited Conduct, the risk posed \\nto any individual or to the campus community by not proceeding, and/or the University’s \\ndetermination about whether its legal obligations compel it to pursue the resolution of a \\nreport. \\nAfter a Formal Complaint has been filed, or signed by the Title IX Coordinator, the \\nuniversity will commence its investigation and resolution process. In order for the \\nallegations set forth in a Formal Complaint to constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct, \\nat the time of filing a Formal Complaint, the Complainant must be participating in or \\nattempting to participate in the University’s Programs or Activities. If the Complainant is \\nnot participating in or attempting to participate in the University’s Programs or \\nActivities at the time the Formal Complaint is filed, the Title IX Coordinator will review',\n",
       " '231 \\n \\n \\nthe Formal Complaint and determine whether to initiate an investigation of Other \\nProhibited Conduct, as specified in Section VI.B below. \\nB. Investigation Procedures \\nUpon the filing of a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator (or designee) will review \\nthe Formal Complaint to determine whether the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal \\nRule Sexual Misconduct. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the allegations in \\nthe Formal Complaint, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct, the Title IX \\nCoordinator must commence an investigation as set forth below. \\nIf the Title IX Coordinator determines that the allegations in the Formal Complaint, if true, \\nwould not constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct but would constitute Other Prohibited \\nConduct, the Title IX Coordinator will review the Formal Complaint to determine whether the \\nallegations, if true, significantly impact the University Community, represent a potential \\nthreat to members of the University Community, or have some other significant connection \\nto the University Community. Based on this review, the Title IX Coordinator will have \\ndiscretion to commence an investigation as set forth below. \\nThroughout the investigation and adjudication of the Formal Complaint, both the \\nComplainant and the Respondent may select an Advisor of their choice. Details \\nconcerning the role of the Advisor are set forth in the applicable adjudication procedures \\nunder Section VI.C and Section VI.E of this Policy. The role of an Advisor in any hearing \\nmay vary based on the applicable adjudication procedures. \\nAfter deciding to commence an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will appoint an \\ninvestigator to review, assess and investigate the Formal Complaint (the “Investigator”). \\nThe Investigator may be a staff member in the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX, a \\nstaff member in Human Resources, a staff member in another department at the \\nuniversity, or an external professional. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for ensuring \\nthat the Investigator has been appropriately trained and is free of conflicts of interest or \\nbias that would impair the investigation. \\nThe Title IX Coordinator will send the Complainant, Respondent and their \\nrespective Advisors a written notice of investigation. The Investigator will conduct an \\ninvestigation and prepare a preliminary investigative report that fairly summarizes the \\nrelevant evidence gathered during the investigation. Prior to preparing any report the \\nInvestigator will request relevant information from the parties as well as work to gather \\nother relevant available evidence. Although the ultimate responsibility for gathering \\navailable evidence rests with the University, the University is unable to compel any person \\nto participate in its grievance process. The university cannot access, consider, disclose, or',\n",
       " \"232 \\n \\n \\notherwise use a party's records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, \\npsychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the \\nprofessional's or paraprofessional's capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are \\nmade and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party, unless \\nthe university obtains that party's voluntary, written consent. Throughout the \\ninvestigation the university will provide both parties equal opportunity for the parties to \\npresent witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and \\nexculpatory evidence. The parties may offer testimony from an expert witness, as \\nspecified in Appendix B to this policy. The preliminary investigative report will be made \\navailable to the Complainant, Respondent and their respective Advisors in electronic or \\nhard-copy format. Any evidence collected during the investigation will also be made \\navailable to the Complainant, Respondent and their respective Advisors for inspection and \\nreview in electronic or hard-copy format. The Complainant and Respondent will have at \\nleast ten (10) business days to review and respond to the preliminary investigative report. \\nThe Investigator will consider any responses submitted by \\nthe Complainant, Respondent and their respective Advisors and prepare a final \\ninvestigative report (“Investigative Report”). \\nThe Title IX Coordinator will review the Investigative Report and all relevant evidence to \\ndetermine whether the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct and/or Other Prohibited Conduct. Allegations that would constitute Federal \\nRule Sexual Misconduct will be adjudicated under Section VI.C regarding Adjudication \\nProcedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct. Allegations that would constitute Other \\nProhibited Conduct will be adjudicated under Section VI.E regarding Adjudication \\nProcedures for Other Prohibited Misconduct. In cases involving multiple allegations which \\ninclude Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct and Other Prohibited Conduct, the university \\nreserves the right to decide whether to adjudicate all allegations in a single process under \\nthe Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct or to separately adjudicate the \\nallegations under separate applicable procedures. \\nWhen the university receives a report of alleged conduct that could constitute Prohibited \\nConduct other than Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct) under \\nthis Policy and could violate other university policies, the university, in its discretion, will \\ndetermine which policy/ies and procedures apply and whether action will be taken under \\nmultiple policies. \\nWith regard to Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct and Other Prohibited Conduct, in the \\nevent that at the time of a report or the conclusion of an investigation it becomes \\napparent that the alleged conduct, if true, would not constitute Federal Rule Sexual\",\n",
       " '233 \\n \\n \\nMisconduct or Other Prohibited Conduct as defined in this Policy, the matter may be \\nadjudicated under another applicable policy or procedure at the university’s discretion. \\nFor any allegation of Prohibited Conduct that allegedly occurred before the effective date \\nof this Policy, the university will use the sexual harassment and/or sexual assault policy \\nthat was in effect at the time the Prohibited Conduct allegedly occurred for the purpose of \\ndefining conduct that constitutes a violation of policy. However the matter will be \\ninvestigated and adjudicated using the current procedures as set forth in Section VI of this \\nPolicy. Complaints where all of the alleged Prohibited Conduct occurred before the \\neffective date of this Policy will be adjudicated using the procedures for Other Prohibited \\nConduct set forth in Section VI.E of this Policy. \\nC. Adjudication Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\nAppointment of Hearing Officer \\nAfter reviewing the Investigative Report prepared under Section VI.B above, if the Title IX \\nCoordinator determines that the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct, the university will conduct a formal hearing. The Title IX Coordinator will appoint \\na hearing officer (“Hearing Officer”) who will be responsible for presiding over a live hearing \\nand making findings of fact and a determination of responsibility with respect to each \\nallegation in the Formal Complaint. The Title IX Coordinator and/or Investigator are not \\neligible to serve as the Hearing Officer. \\nConduct of the Hearing & Written Determination \\nThe Hearing Officer will conduct a live hearing in accordance with the Hearing Procedures for \\nthe Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct [pdf]. The hearing will take place no \\nsooner than ten days after the parties are provided with the Investigative Report. \\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer will make findings of fact and a \\ndetermination of responsibility with respect to each allegation. The determination of \\nresponsibility will be made using the preponderance of evidence standard. \\nIf the Hearing Officer determines that the Respondent is responsible for any allegation, \\nthe Hearing Officer will contact the appropriate sanctioning officer, as specified below, to \\nreview the findings of findings of fact and determination(s) regarding responsibility \\n(“Sanctioning Officer”). The Sanctioning Officer will have sole responsibility for \\ndetermining the appropriate sanctions and remedies related to any finding of \\nresponsibility made by the Hearing Officer. The Sanctioning Officer will provide a written \\ndetermination regarding sanctions to the Hearing Officer. If the Hearing Officer',\n",
       " '234 \\n \\n \\ndetermines that the Respondent is not responsible for any of the allegations, the \\nSanctioning Officer will not be contacted. \\nThe applicable Sanctioning Officer is based on the nature of the Respondent’s relationship \\nto the university: \\n• Sanctioning Officer for Students: Associate Vice President of Student Affairs for \\nCommunity Life or designee \\n• Sanctioning Officer for Staff: Associate Vice President & Chief Human Resources Officer \\nor designee \\n• Sanctioning Officer for Faculty: Provost or designee \\nThe Hearing Officer will prepare a written determination regarding the findings of fact and \\nthe determination regarding responsibility for each allegation.

An appeal that does not meet at least one of the acceptable bases for \\nappeal may be dismissed without further review. \\nAppeals will be decided by the Appeal Officer in a timely manner as circumstances \\nwarrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the Respondent(s) \\nand Complainant(s) as necessary about the anticipated timeline.',\n",

The Appeal Officer may \\nalso remand the matter for a new live hearing under Section VI.C of this Policy. \\nThe Appeal Officer will issue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and the \\nrationale for the result. The Appeal Officer will provide the written decision \\nsimultaneously to both the Complainant and Respondent. The Title IX Coordinator will \\nalso receive a copy of the decision. \\nE. Adjudication Procedures for Other Prohibited Conduct \\nThe specific procedures for adjudicating allegations of Prohibited Conduct that, if true, \\nwould not constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct) are \\nbased upon the nature of the Respondent’s relationship to the university. \\n• Where the Respondent is a Student — the matter will be handled in accordance with \\nthe university’s Student Community Standards Process, which is set forth in the \\nCommunity Standards section of The Word.

An appeal must \\nbe submitted in writing to the Office of the President within seven (7) calendar days of \\nthe notification of the decision of the Hearing Officer to the Complainant and \\nRespondent. The basis for an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following: \\n• Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;  \\n• New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination \\nregarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of \\nthe matter;  \\n• The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Hearing Officer, or Provost had a conflict \\nof interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the \\nindividual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; \\nand \\n• The sanctions recommended by the Provost are disproportionate to the finding of \\nresponsibility. \\nAppeals will be adjudicated by the President or the President’s designee. The President \\nor the President’s designee will issue a written decision describing the result of the \\nappeal and the rationale for the result. The appeal decision will be provided to the \\nComplainant, the Respondent, and the Title IX Coordinator.  \\nWhere the Provost recommends sanctions against a Faculty member, the President \\nwill take no action on the recommended sanctions until either (i) the completion of any \\nappeal filed by any party (ii) the deadline to file an appeal passes without any appeal \\nbeing filed. If an appeal is filed, the President or the President’s designee will render a \\ndecision on the appeal and will issue a written decision describing the result of the \\nappeal and the rationale for the result. The appeal decision will be provided to the \\nFormal Complaint, the Respondent, and the Title IX Coordinator. \\nIf any sanctions remain after the completion of the appeal or where no appeal is filed \\nby the appeal deadline, the President will thereafter render a decision based on both \\nthe recommendation of the Provost as well as the underlying findings of fact and \\ndetermination(s) of responsibility. If the President decides to initiate the procedure for \\ndismissal for cause or for the imposition of another sanction against a Faculty \\nRespondent, the matter will then follow the process set forth in the subsection \\n\"Procedure\" of the section of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon',\n",
       " '238 \\n \\n \\nUniversity titled, \"Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions\", but will be subject to the \\n\"Exceptions\" provision of that subsection such that no Ad-Hoc Committee will be \\nrequired. \\n• Where the Respondent has dual-status (e.g. more than one status as Faculty, Staff or \\nStudent) — the university has discretion to determine which process to use under \\nSection VI.E depending on the circumstances of the case. \\n• Where the Respondent is a third party — The university’s ability to take appropriate \\ncorrective action against a third party will be determined by the nature of the third \\nparty’s relationship to the university. The Title IX Coordinator will determine the \\nappropriate manner of resolution in accordance with the university’s commitment to a \\nprompt and equitable process and consistent with state and federal law, regulations, \\nguidance, and this Policy. \\nF. Possible Outcomes & Sanctions from Adjudication \\nPossible outcomes from a violation of this Policy range from educational outcomes to \\nseparation from the university. A detailed list of the possible remedies and sanctions is \\navailable in Appendix A to this Policy. \\nG. Alternative Resolutions \\nThis Policy describes two procedures for the formal resolution of Prohibited Misconduct – \\na procedure for the adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct in Section VI.C and a \\nprocedure for Other Prohibited Conduct in Section VI.E. Separate from these formal \\nresolution procedures, the university offers several forms of alternative resolution \\n(“Alternative Resolution”) procedures that may be available on a voluntary basis to resolve \\na Formal Complaint under this Policy. \\nIndividuals interested in an Alternative Resolution should contact the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX to discuss options. For information regarding the types of \\nAlternate Resolution procedures that may be available please see Office for Institutional \\nEquity and Title IX website. \\nEither party may request to pursue an Alternative Resolution at any time after the filing of \\nthe Formal Complaint and before a finding of responsibility under Section VI.C or Section \\nVI.E. The Title IX Coordinator has discretion to determine whether the parties will be \\npermitted to pursue an Alternative Resolution. Alternative Resolutions are not available in \\ncases involving a Student Complainant and a Faculty or Staff Respondent. In general,',\n",
       " '239 \\n \\n \\nmediation and other Alternative Resolution procedures that are similar to mediation will \\nnot be used to resolve matters involving an allegation of sexual violence (i.e. Sexual \\nAssault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence or any other form of Prohibited Conduct that \\ninvolves the use of violence). \\nAfter receiving a request to pursue an Alternative Resolution, the Title IX Coordinator will \\ncontact both parties to assess mutual interest in the Alternative Resolution. If both parties \\nwish to pursue Alternative Resolution, and the Title IX Coordinator agrees that Alternative \\nResolution is appropriate under the specific facts and circumstances of the case, the Title \\nIX Coordinator will provide the Complainant and Respondent with a written notice \\nproviding (i) the allegations in the Formal Complaint; (ii) the specific Alternative Resolution \\nmethod desired by the parties; (iii) details of the procedures for the Alternative \\nResolution; (iv) a summary of the possible consequences and outcomes of the Alternative \\nResolution, and (v) information regarding the confidentiality and/or accessibility of the \\nrecords of the Alternative Resolution. After receiving this notice, both \\nthe Complainant and Respondent must provide written consent to the Title IX Coordinator \\nin order to proceed with the Alternative Resolution. \\nDuring any Alternative Resolution process, either party has the right to withdraw from the \\nprocess at any time prior to the conclusion of the process. If either party withdraws from \\nthe Alternative Resolution process or if the parties are unable to successfully resolve the \\nmatter at the conclusion of the Alternative Resolution process, the matter will proceed to \\ninvestigation under Section VI.B or to adjudication under Section VI.C or Section VI.E, as \\nappropriate. \\nH. Student Emergency Removal \\nWhere there is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any Students or \\nother individuals arising from alleged Prohibited Conduct, the university may remove an \\nindividual from the University’s Program or Activity and issue any necessary related no-\\ntrespass and no-contact orders during the pendency of the investigation. The university \\nwill make the decision to remove an individual from the University’s Program or \\nActivity based on an individualized assessment and risk analysis. \\nFor Students, an emergency removal decision will be made in accordance with the Safety \\nIntervention Protocol set forth in The Word. In the event the university removes any \\nperson on this basis, the university will provide an opportunity for the affected individual',\n",
       " '240 \\n \\n \\nto challenge the removal promptly thereafter, as specified in the Safety Intervention \\nProtocol. \\nVII. Additional Information about Reporting \\nA. How the Title IX Coordinator and University Police Share Information about Prohibited \\nConduct with Each Other \\nThe university’s process for addressing Prohibited Conduct is separate from the law \\nenforcement process for addressing crimes.  \\nThe university strongly believes that the decision as to whether to report a crime should \\nbe left to the individual(s) impacted by the crime, except in very limited circumstances \\nwhere there may be an immediate threat to the University Community. The Title IX \\nCoordinator will share de-identified information about reports with University Police for \\nthe purpose of complying with the university’s federal reporting obligations to facilitate \\naccurate compilation of crime statistics, and to ensure that other public safety \\nresponsibilities are addressed. In extremely limited circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator \\nmay share identifying information with University Police, for example, where the \\nuniversity is obligated to report a “Timely Warning” pursuant to Jeanne Clery Disclosure of \\nCampus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (e.g., when a crime has been \\ncommitted on or near University Property which represents a serious, ongoing threat \\nand/or is part of an ongoing pattern). The report does not constitute a criminal complaint \\nto law enforcement, although the University Police Department may contact individuals to \\noffer assistance, inquire about their willingness to preserve evidence, or file a criminal \\ncomplaint.  \\nMaking a report to the University Police means that information will be shared with others \\nas is necessary and appropriate. For example, if an individual makes a report \\nof Prohibited Conduct to the University Police Department that has not already been \\nreported to the Title IX Coordinator, the University Police Department will report the \\nmatter to the Title IX Coordinator. The purpose of this report is to ensure that the \\nuniversity can take appropriate actions to seek to eliminate Prohibited Conduct, prevent \\nits recurrence, and remedy its effects. The Complainant or others may be contacted by \\nthe Title IX Coordinator to follow up on the information received from the University \\nPolice Department to offer supportive measures, including filing a Formal Complaint with \\nthe Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX.',\n",
       " '241 \\n \\n \\nB. Time Frame for Reporting an Incident to the University \\nThe university strongly encourages individuals to report possible Prohibited \\nConduct promptly. Although the university does not limit the time frame for \\nreporting Prohibited Conduct, it may be more difficult for the university to gather relevant \\nand reliable evidence or to take corrective action regarding conduct that is reported to have \\noccurred relatively long ago. \\nIf the Respondent is no longer a Student, Staff member, Faculty member, or participant in \\nany university program or activity at the time of the report, or if the conduct does not fall \\nwithin the scope of the Policy, the university’s ability to take action against the Respondent \\nunder the Policy may be limited. The university will, however, also help \\na Complainant identify other options outside the university, such as local law \\nenforcement, and provide support and resources. \\nC. Information on Amnesty to Students When Reporting Prohibited Conduct to the \\nUniversity \\nThe university will not pursue university Prohibited Conduct charges against any Student \\nin an investigation under this Policy for potential violations of university policy for \\npersonal consumption of alcohol or other drugs identified during an investigation, as long \\nas any such violations did not and do not place the health or safety of any other person at \\nrisk. The university may, however, initiate an assessment, educational discussion, or \\npursue other developmental interventions (non-disciplinary options) to address the \\nalcohol or other drug use. \\nVIII. Obligations of University Employees \\nAll Carnegie Mellon community members are strongly encouraged to report information \\nabout potential violations of this Policy to the Title IX Coordinator. Sharing information \\nwith the Title IX Coordinator does not initiate a formal investigation or impose any \\nobligations on the Complainant. However, disclosing information to the Title IX \\nCoordinator enables the university to offer supportive measures to the party so that they \\nmay maintain equal access to their education and work environments. \\nResponsible Employees have a heightened obligation to report information of potential \\npolicy violations. All Staff and Faculty who are Responsible Employees are required to \\npromptly share with the Title IX Coordinator all details they receive in the scope of their \\nemployment about Prohibited Conduct. Responsible Employees can make a report to the \\nTitle IX Coordinator by contacting the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX.',\n",
       " '242 \\n \\n \\nFailure by a Responsible Employees to promptly share with the Title IX Coordinator all \\ndetails they receive, including names of involved parties, in the scope of their employment \\nabout Prohibited Conduct may subject them to appropriate discipline, up to and including \\nremoval from their position. \\nThe following positions are Responsible Employees: \\n• University administrators and supervisors; and \\n• Employees holding any of the roles or titles list below, including those serving in an \\ninterim or acting basis: \\nFaculty or Staff Administrators \\n• President; \\n• Provost; \\n• Vice-Presidents (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); \\n• Vice-Provosts (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); \\n• Deans (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); \\n• Department Chairs (including those serving in associate and assistant roles, graduate \\nchairs, and undergraduate chairs); \\n• Directors; and \\n• Supervisors (i.e., employees who have authority to hire, transfer, suspend, layoff, \\nrecall, promote, discharge, reward, or discipline other employees). \\nStudent Affairs \\n• All Staff members (including any individual, whether an employee or not, who serves \\nas a coach of a club sports team), excluding administrative assistants, custodial, \\nmaintenance, and dining employees; and \\n• Community Advisors and Resident Assistants in Residential Education. \\nAthletics \\n• All Staff members, excluding administrative assistants, custodial, maintenance, and \\ndining employees. \\nUniversity Police \\n• All Staff members.',\n",
       " '243 \\n \\n \\nOther \\n• All Human Resources Staff members (central, school, college, division, and/or unit) who \\nare responsible for handling employment issues, excluding clerical and transactional \\nemployees; \\n• All Staff members and Faculty members who provide oversight to or travel with \\nStudents on university-related travel abroad, including university-sponsored study \\nabroad, research, fieldwork, or internship programs. Unless designated as \\na Responsible Employees in another role at the university, staff and Faculty \\nmembers who provide oversight to or travel with Students on university related travel \\nabroad, are only considered Responsible Employees with respect to concerns they \\nbecome aware of connected to the program with which they provide oversight or \\ntravel abroad with Students; and \\n• Faculty and Staff members serving as identified advisers to student organizations. \\nConfidential Resources, such as individuals employed at CaPS and the University Health \\nCenter, acting in that capacity, are not Responsible Employees. Nevertheless, these \\nindividuals can serve as connection points to Supportive Measures through the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX if desired by a party. \\nResponsible Employees are not required to report when incidents of Prohibited Conduct \\nare communicated/disclosed during a classroom discussion, in an assignment for a class \\n(and in discussions outside of class time (e.g., during office hours) related to the \\nassignment), or as part of a research project directly associated with the class. \\nResponsible Employees also are not required to report information disclosed at sexual \\nmisconduct public awareness events (e.g., Take Back the Night, candlelight vigils, protests, \\nor survivor speak-outs in which participants may disclose incidents of Prohibited \\nConduct). \\nIf you are unsure of whether you are a Responsible Employee, please contact the Title IX \\nCoordinator in order to help clarify your role and responsibilities. \\nIX. Definitions \\nA. Sexual Misconduct Definitions \\nPROHIBITED CONDUCT means one or more categories of prohibited behavior including: \\n• Sexual Assault;',\n",
       " '244 \\n \\n \\n• Sexual Exploitation; \\n• Sexual Harassment; \\n• Dating Violence; \\n• Domestic Violence; \\n• Stalking; \\n• Retaliation; and \\n• Violation of Protective Measures. \\nDefinitions for each of the types of Prohibited Conduct are provided below. \\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT means any unwelcome conduct or cues of a sexual nature, whether \\nverbal/aural (sounds), visual/graphic (e.g. pictures and videos), physical, or otherwise, when: \\n• Submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition \\nof a person’s employment, education, living environment, or participation in any \\nUniversity Program or Activity (commonly known as Quid Pro Quo); \\n• Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for or a \\nfactor in decisions affecting that individual’s employment, education, living \\nenvironment, or participation in a University Program or Activity (commonly known as \\nQuid Pro Quo); and/or \\n• Such conduct creates a hostile environment. A hostile environment exists when the \\nunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive \\nthat it unreasonably interferes with an individual’s participation in a university \\nprogram or activity or creates an intimidating, hostile, offensive, or abusive \\nenvironment for that individual’s participation in a University Program or Activity \\n(commonly known as Hostile Environment). \\nExamples of conduct that may constitute Sexual Harassment include but are not limited to: \\no Unwanted intentional touching that otherwise does not typically constitute Sexual \\nAssault, defined in this Policy; \\no Unwanted sexual advances, including repeated unwanted requests for dates, or \\nrepeated unwanted requests for sexual contact; \\no Unwanted written, verbal, or electronic statements of a sexual nature, including \\nsexually suggestive comments, jokes, videos or innuendos;',\n",
       " '245 \\n \\n \\no Exposing one’s genitalia, breasts, or buttocks, to another; and/or \\no Touching oneself sexually for others to view. \\nThis definition addresses intentional conduct. It also includes conduct that results in \\nnegative effects even though such negative effects were unintended. Unwelcome conduct \\nof a sexual nature constitutes Sexual Harassment if a Reasonable Person would consider \\nit sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive as to interfere unreasonably with academic, \\nother educational, or employment performance or participation in a university activity or \\nliving environment. \\nSEXUAL ASSAULT means a physical, sexual act directed against another person without their \\nConsent, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving Consent. Sexual Assault \\ncan occur between two individual of the same or different sexes and/or genders. This \\nincludes the following: \\nI. \\nRAPE means the carnal knowledge of a person, without the Consent of the victim, \\nincluding instances where the victim does not have the Capacity to give Consent; \\nII. \\nSODOMY means oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the \\nConsent of the victim, including instances where the victim does not have the \\nCapacity to give Consent; \\nIII. \\nSEXUAL ASSAULT WITH AN OBJECT means to use an object or instrument to \\nunlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of \\nanother person, without the Consent of the victim, including instances where the \\nvictim does not have the Capacity to give Consent; \\nIV. \\nFONDLING means the touching of the private body parts of another person for the \\npurpose of sexual gratification, where the victim does not have the Capacity to give \\nConsent; \\nV. \\nINCEST means sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other \\nwithin the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law; or \\nVI. \\nSTATUTORY RAPE means sexual intercourse with a person who is under the \\nstatutory age of Consent in the applicable jurisdiction.  \\nIn the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the age of consent for sexual activity is 16. \\nMinors aged 16 years of age or older can legally consent to sexual activity with \\nanyone they choose, as long as the other person does not have authority over them \\nas defined in Pennsylvania’s institutional sexual assault statute. Minors under the \\nage of 13 cannot consent to sexual activity. Minors aged 13-15 years old cannot',\n",
       " \"246 \\n \\n \\nconsent to sexual activity with anyone who is 4 or more years older than they are at \\nthe time of the activity. \\nDATING VIOLENCE means any act of violence, including sexual violence, physical violence, or \\nthe threat of such violence, committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship \\nof a romantic or intimate nature with the victim and where the existence of such a \\nrelationship is determined based on a consideration of the length, type, and frequency of \\ninteractions between the persons involved in the relationship. \\nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE means any act of violence, including sexual violence, physical violence, \\nor the threat of such violence, committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner \\nof the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is \\ncohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a \\nperson similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws \\nof the jurisdiction receiving grant monies, or by any other person against an adult or youth \\nvictim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of \\nthe jurisdiction. \\nSTALKING means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would \\ncause a Reasonable Person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or suffer \\nsubstantial emotional distress. \\nSEXUAL EXPLOITATION  \\nmeans intentionally or knowingly taking sexual advantage of another person or violating the \\nsexual privacy of another when Consent is not present. This includes, but is not limited to, \\nthe following actions (including when they are done via electronic means, methods or \\ndevices): \\n• engaging in sexual voyeurism including observing or permitting others to witness or \\nobserve the sexual or intimate activity (e.g., disrobing, bathing, toileting) of another \\nperson without that person’s Consent; \\n• engaging in indecent exposure, or exposing intimate parts (including genitalia, groin, \\nbreasts and/or buttocks), or causing another to expose intimate parts when Consent is \\nnot present; \\n• recording or distributing information, images or recordings of any person engaged in \\nsexual or intimate activity in a private space without that person’s Consent; \\n• prostituting another individual;\",\n",
       " '247 \\n \\n \\n• causing Incapacitation of another person (through alcohol, drugs or other means) for \\nthe purpose of compromising that person’s ability to give Consent to non-consensual \\nsexual activity; or \\n• actively aiding or assisting another person in committing an act of Prohibited Conduct. \\nRETALIATION means an adverse (negative) action taken against a person for making a \\ngood faith report of Prohibited Conduct, being alleged to have committed Prohibited \\nConduct, participating, or refusing to participate, in any proceeding under this Policy. \\n• Retaliation may include intimidation, threats, coercion, harassment, or discrimination \\n(including charging a Respondent under a different university policy instead of this \\nPolicy for the purpose of interfering with any right or privileged secured by Title IX or \\nits implementing regulations). \\n• Retaliation may also include adverse employment or educational actions that would \\ndiscourage a Reasonable Person from engaging in a Protected Activity protected under \\nthis Policy. \\nA finding of retaliation under this Policy is not dependent on a finding that the underlying \\nsexual misconduct occurred. Retaliation is also prohibited by the university’s Policy Against \\nRetaliation. \\nSupportive Measures and other actions taken in accordance with this or other university \\npolicies generally do not constitute Retaliation. Similarly, charging an individual with a code of \\nconduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a \\ngrievance proceeding under this Policy does not constitute prohibited Retaliation, provided, \\nhowever, that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that \\nany party made a materially false statement in bad faith. Retaliation also does not include \\npursuit of civil, criminal, or other legal action, internal or external to the university. \\nPROTECTED ACTIVITY means participating in the university’s processes related to this \\nPolicy, including but not limited to reporting Prohibited Conduct; pursuing a resolution of \\nProhibited Conduct; providing evidence in any investigation or hearing; or intervening to \\nprotect others who may have suffered Prohibited Conduct. \\nB. Definitions Relating to Consent \\nCONSENT means a knowing and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity at the \\ntime of the activity. In order to be valid, consent must be knowing, voluntary, active,',\n",
       " '248 \\n \\n \\npresent and ongoing. Consent should be demonstrated through mutually understandable \\nwords or actions. \\n• Silence, remaining still or inactive (passive), or not actively resisting sexual activity does \\nnot imply consent. \\n• Consent to engage in one sexual activity does not mean consent to engage in another \\nsexual activity. Consent must be obtained each time, at each step of sexual activity. \\n• Prior consent does not mean future consent. Consent must be obtained each time, at \\neach step of sexual activity, even for those in an ongoing sexual relationship. \\n• Consent can be withdrawn at any time. If one individual withdraws consent through \\nclear words or actions, the other person must cease sexual activity immediately. \\n• Consent cannot be obtained through Force, Incapacitation or Coercion (as defined \\nhere in). \\nFORCE means using physical control (such as restraining a person), physical violence (such \\nas hitting, choking or displaying a weapon), or threats of either to cause a person to \\nsubmit to unwanted sexual activity. \\nCOERCION means using an unreasonable amount of pressure or threats that would \\novercome the will of a Reasonable Person and cause them to submit to unwanted sexual \\nactivity. Coercion requires more than an attempt to persuade someone to engage in \\nsexual activity. Coercion can include threats, such as threats to cause academic, \\nemployment, reputational or economic harm. When one person expresses that they do \\nnot consent to sexual activity or are withdrawing consent for sexual activity, applying \\ncontinued pressure in order to get the person to submit to unwanted sexual activity can \\nbe considered Coercion. \\nINCAPACITATION means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, deliberate \\nchoices about whether or not to engage in sexual activity. A person is Incapacitated — \\nunable to give consent — because they are: \\n• under the age of consent (generally 16 years of age in Pennsylvania; see definition of \\nStatutory Rape for additional information); \\n• physically or mentally helpless; \\n• asleep or unconscious; or \\n• unaware that sexual activity was requested, suggested, initiated and/or is taking place.',\n",
       " '249 \\n \\n \\nA person may be Incapacitated by the use of alcohol or other drugs. Incapacitation is a state \\nbeyond intoxication or drunkenness. A person is not necessarily Incapacitated solely as a result \\nof drinking or using drugs; the level of impairment must be significant enough to render the \\nperson unable to give Consent. \\nFor example, a person who is Incapacitated may not be able to answer some or all of the \\nfollowing questions: \\no Do you know where you are?  \\no Do you know how you got here?  \\no Do you know what is happening?  \\no Do you know whom you are with? \\nA person who is Incapacitated may also demonstrate physical signs including but not limited to: \\no slurred or incomprehensible speech; \\no unsteady manner of walking or inability to walk; \\no vomiting or incontinence (a lack of voluntary control over urination and/or defecation). \\nIf a person under the influence of alcohol or drugs decides to participate in sexual activity that \\nthey would not participate in while sober, it does not necessarily mean that the person was \\nIncapacitated or that the Consent was not valid. \\nImportantly, being impaired by alcohol or other drugs is not a defense to a failure to obtain \\nConsent. \\nCAPACITY means that the person has the ability under the law to give Consent to engage \\nin sexual activity. This means that the person must be: \\n• Of legal age to give Consent (generally at least 16 years of age in Pennsylvania; see \\ndefinition of Statutory Rape for additional information); and \\n• Able to make informed, deliberate choices about whether or not to engage in sexual \\nactivity. \\nA person who is not able to give consent is considered to be Incapacitated. \\nC. Policy Definitions \\nACTUAL KNOWLEDGE means that the university has notice of alleged Sexual Misconduct \\nbecause the alleged misconduct has been reported to the Title IX Coordinator or any \\nofficial of the university who has the authority to institute corrective measures on behalf',\n",
       " '250 \\n \\n \\nof the university. These are individuals whose “actual knowledge” may be imputed to the \\nuniversity. \\nADVISOR: An individual who provides support and advice for the Complainant or \\nRespondent. The Complainant and Respondent may have an Advisor of their choice, who \\nmay be, but is not required to be, an attorney. \\nIf either party does not have an Advisor present at the live hearing conducted under \\nSection VI.C, the university will provide, without fee or charge to that party, a substitute \\nAdvisor of the university’s choice who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. In \\nthis event, the role of the Advisor provided by the university will be limited to the \\nconducting of cross examination on behalf of the party that did not have an Advisor. \\nCOMPLAINANT: In most circumstances, Complainant means a person who is reported to \\nhave experienced Prohibited Conduct. The term Complainant also includes such \\nindividuals who file a Formal Complaint and who participates in a process undertaken by \\nthe university to address the report of Prohibited Conduct (including Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct). In some cases, a Complainant may be different than the person who initially \\nreports information to the university. \\nEMPLOYEE: person who is employed by the university to perform one or more of the \\nfollowing roles: regular instructional faculty, supplemental instructional faculty, research \\ntrack faculty, visiting faculty, librarians, archivists, curators, graduate student instructors, \\ngraduate student staff assistants, graduate student research assistants, postdoctoral \\nresearch fellows, and all regular and temporary staff. \\nFACULTY/FACULTY MEMBER means all individuals who hold appointments on the tenure-\\ntrack, research-track, teaching-track, librarian/archivist-track and special faculty track of \\nthe university, as well as individuals holding Emeritus Faculty status. \\nFEDERAL RULE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT is a subset of Prohibited Conduct which meets the \\ndefinition of Sexual Harassment in the Title IX Regulations at 34 CFR Part 106.30. \\nSomething which meets the definition of category of Prohibited Conduct (defined above) \\nrises to the level of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct when it meets ALL of the following \\nthree conditions: \\n• The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and \\n• The conduct took place within the University’s Programs or Activities. \\nPLUS one or more of the following conditions:',\n",
       " '251 \\n \\n \\ni. An Employee engages in Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment against a Student; and/or \\nii. An individual engages in hostile environment Sexual Harassment that is so severe, \\npervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies another person equal access to \\nthe University’s Programs or Activities; and/or \\niii. An individual engages in Sexual Assault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, or \\nStalking. \\nFORMAL COMPLAINT means a written or typed document, signed by the Complainant or \\nthe Title IX Coordinator (electronically or otherwise), which requests that the university \\ninitiate the procedures outlined in Section VI. If the Complainant is under the age of 18 \\nand not enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program, the Complainant’s parent or \\nguardian must sign the Formal Complaint. \\nOTHER PROHIBITED CONDUCT means any Prohibited Conduct that does not meet the \\ndefinition of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct. \\nREASONABLE PERSON a person using average care, intelligence, and judgment in the \\nknown circumstances. \\nREPORT means information shared with the university’s Title IX Coordinator about one or \\nmore incidents of Prohibited Conduct which have occurred (or is continuing to occur) and \\nwhich: \\n• has impacted (or continues to impact) one or more members of the University \\nCommunity; and/or \\n• was or is committed by one or more members of the University Community; and/or \\n• occurred or is occurring on property owned or controlled by the University or within \\nthe University’s Programs or Activities.  \\nRESPONDENT: an individual who is reported to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct \\n(including Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct). \\nRESPONSIBLE EMPLOYEE: an individual who is required to report information of alleged \\nProhibited Misconduct (including Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct) to the university’s Title \\nIX Coordinator. The categories of “Responsible Employee” includes: \\n1. University administrators and supervisors; and \\n2. Employees in certain designated positions and units or departments. \\nA Responsible Employee is required to share all relevant information about the alleged \\nProhibited Conduct, of which they are aware, with the Title IX Coordinator within 48',\n",

Name (or names) of Respondent(s); \\nc. Details about the nature of the alleged Prohibited Conduct; and \\nd. Any information available about location(s), date(s), and/or time(s). \\nA full list of Responsible Employees and more information about a Responsible \\nEmployee’s obligations can be found in Section VIII. \\nA Responsible Employee’s receipt of information about alleged Prohibited Conduct (including \\nFederal Rule Sexual Misconduct) will not automatically trigger a formal resolution under this \\nPolicy. The university will only commence Formal Resolution upon receipt of a Formal \\nComplaint signed by the Complainant or the Title IX Coordinator. \\nSTAFF/STAFF MEMBER means all Employees of the university who do not hold faculty \\nappointments. Staff does not include individuals whose primary relationship with the \\nuniversity is as a Student. \\nSTUDENT a person who was selected by the university for part-time, full-time, special, \\nassociate, transfer, exchange, or any other enrollment, membership, or matriculation in \\nor at any of the University’s Programs or Activities. \\nUNIVERSITY COMMUNITY refers to university Students, Faculty and Staff. \\nUNIVERSITY'S PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES: Conduct takes place in the “University’s \\nPrograms or Activities” when that conduct occurs: (1) in a location, at an event, or in a \\ncircumstance where the university exercises substantial control over both the Respondent \\nand the context in which the conduct occurs; or (2) in any building owned or controlled by \\na student organization recognized by the university. \\nExamples: Conduct that occurs on-campus occurs within the University’s Programs or \\nActivities. Conduct that occurs off campus in locations or at events with no connection to \\nthe university is unlikely to occur in a program or activity of the university. \\nVIOLATION OF PROTECTIVE MEASURES \\nAny violation of an agreement or order that limits an individual’s contact or interactions \\nwith another individual.

This commitment extends to encouraging and supporting the reduction of \\nsignificant health risks to members of the community. Smoking of tobacco products is one \\nsuch risk. This Policy is intended not only to relieve community members from negative \\neffects of tobacco smoking by others, but also to promote and assist smoking cessation \\nby existing users and discourage new addictions. \\nPolicies that strictly regulate smoking have been demonstrated to reduce exposure to \\nsecond-hand smoke, tobacco-related death and disease, and attendant healthcare costs. \\nIn addition, several systematic reviews of studies have demonstrated effectiveness of \\nsuch policies in reducing the prevalence of tobacco use, increasing the number of tobacco \\nusers who quit, and reducing the initiation of tobacco use among young people. These \\npositive effects have led leading national health organizations to advocate a smoke-free \\npolicy intervention. Benchmarking suggests that a “smoke-less” approach, an alternative \\nto prohibition that honors our campus geography and is grounded in sustained and \\nvisible efforts to reduce smoking and promote cessation, can also have positive effects. \\nThe effects of exposure to smoke from tobacco were documented in the 2006, 2010, and \\n2014 U.S. Surgeon General’s Reports. Further research is needed to determine the public \\nhealth risks and benefits of e-cigarettes and other novel nicotine products. Although \\nharmful consequences of e-cigarette vapor have not been demonstrated to the standards',\n",
       " '257 \\n \\n \\nused for conventional cigarettes, the practice of using these products may have social \\nimpact. In addition, some state and local governments, including Allegheny County, have \\npassed laws regulating the use of e-cigarettes. Therefore, this Policy addresses both the \\nsmoking of tobacco products and the use of e-cigarettes. As evidence becomes more \\nconclusive, this Policy may be amended to further address novel nicotine products. \\nPolicy Statement \\nSmoking of tobacco products is prohibited in all university buildings and facilities owned, \\nleased, or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, including campus vehicles. Smoking of \\ntobacco products is also prohibited on all grounds and outside areas except for limited \\ndesignated outdoor areas where the negative effects of second-hand exposure is deemed \\nsufficiently low. As such, major campus thoroughfares, gathering spaces and entrances to \\nbuildings are not designated areas. The number, nature and location of designated areas \\nwas determined by an oversight committee convened by the university’s Environmental \\nHealth & Safety department and comprised of representatives from Faculty Senate, \\nGraduate Student Assembly, Staff Council and Student Senate. \\n• Designated Smoking Areas [pdf] \\n• Tobacco Cessation Resources [pdf] \\nUse of e-cigarettes and vaporizers is prohibited inside all university buildings and inside all \\nproperty owned, leased or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, but is not prohibited \\noutside on campus grounds as of the adoption of this Policy. \\nFor the purpose of this Policy, a tobacco product is defined as any product made or \\nderived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption by smoking. Examples of \\ntobacco products include, but are not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, and pipe \\ntobacco. \\nFor the purpose of this Policy, an e-cigarette is defined as any electronic oral device, such \\nas one composed of a heating element, battery or electronic circuit, which provides a \\nvapor of nicotine or any other substances and the use or inhalation of which simulates \\nsmoking. The term shall include any such device, whether manufactured, distributed, \\nmarketed or sold as an e-cigarette, e-cigar or e-pipe or under any other product name or \\ndescriptor. \\nThis Policy does not apply to the use of tobacco products, e-cigarettes or vaporizers for \\nofficial academic research so long as such use of these products complies with all \\napplicable local, state, and federal laws.',\n",

The absence of adequate \\nhealth insurance coverage is a barrier to care that can result in temporary or permanent',\n",
       " '260 \\n \\n \\ninterruption of a student’s education. The university is committed to offering student \\nhealth insurance that provides access to quality health care and achieves a balance \\nbetween premium cost and adequate coverage without overburdening students’ financial \\nresources. This balance is best achieved through a student health insurance requirement \\nthat mitigates the effect of adverse selection while providing another option for coverage.  \\nPolicy Statement \\nAll full-time students are required to carry health insurance that meets certain standards \\nof coverage.  In the absence of adequate health insurance coverage, the student is \\nrequired to enroll in the student health insurance plan. \\nImplementation Guidelines \\nThe process for selection of vendors for the student health insurance plan shall adhere to \\ninstitutional requirements relative to competitive vendor selection processes. The student \\nhealth insurance program shall be reviewed annually by University Health Services (UHS) \\nand student consumers including representatives from Student Senate and the Graduate \\nStudent Assembly to ensure that the program meets the needs of covered individuals, \\nprovides the desired level of benefit at the least possible cost and returns as much of the \\npremium to covered individuals in the form of benefits as possible. \\nThe health insurance program shall be available to all eligible students without regard to \\nrace, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender \\nidentity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, pre-existing medical or mental \\nhealth condition or genetic information. \\nAll full-time students will be assessed a charge for the individual basic health insurance \\nplan offered through the university student health insurance program. The charge will \\nappear on the invoice of the first semester of attendance in the academic cycle.  The \\nstudent is expected to actively enroll in the plan or apply for a waiver from the student \\ninsurance plan during the open enrollment. Failure to take action will result in automatic \\nenrollment in the student health insurance plan. \\nApplication or modification of this policy for non-Pittsburgh locations will be determined \\nby the Director of University Health Services, in consultation with relevant colleagues in \\nthose locations. \\nRequirements for Waiver \\nApplication for waiver from the university student health insurance plan must be \\nsubmitted to UHS by the last day of the open enrollment period.  Students applying for \\nwaiver must provide documentation of:',\n",

In cases where there is no individual bringing forward an allegation, the \\nuniversity may act as complainant. Further, in cases where there is a community member \\nbringing forward an allegation, a university official may serve as co-complainant where the \\nuniversity determines that a broader community interest exists to safeguard the welfare of \\nthe university community and when the potential outcome in such a case could include \\nseparation from the university. \\n• Hearing Officer – The Hearing Officer is appointed by the dean of students or designee. A \\nHearing Officer may be an employee of Carnegie Mellon, or a third party engaged by the \\nuniversity, who has been trained to serve in this role. The Hearing Officer is responsible for \\nconducting the hearing, making a determination regarding relevancy of information as well \\nas responsibility for each allegation. If applicable, the Hearing Officer will recommend \\noutcomes to the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs for Community Life.  \\n• Moderator – The Student Affairs staff member who facilitates a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee hearing. Moderators are appointed and trained by the Office of Community \\nStandards & Integrity. The hearing runs at their discretion according to process guidelines. \\n• Process Advisor – As a member of the team in the Office of Community Standards & Integrity, \\nthe Process Advisor is responsible for the logistics of convening a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee.

The Resolution Review Board also reviews and approves \\nproposed outcomes stemming from Administrative Resolution Meetings. \\n• Respondent – The person(s), group, or student organization alleged to have violated \\ncommunity standards. \\n• Student – Any person registered for, enrolled in, or auditing any course(s) at Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity at the time of the alleged violation. For community standards purposes, an \\nindividual is also considered to be a student if they have accepted their offer of admission \\nand are not yet enrolled. Examples include, but are not limited to, students who are enrolled \\nbut not taking classes due to an academic break, medical leave, suspension, or other \\npersonal leave; students who were enrolled at the time of the incident; persons who \\ndemonstrate an intent to enroll by registering for courses; and students participating in study \\nabroad programs. \\n• Support Person – A person of the student's choosing who accompanies the student to any \\nmeeting related to the community standards process, including a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee hearing. The role of the support person is limited to supporting the student in \\nmeetings or a hearing.

The initial information for the complaint or report may be provided by a student, \\nfaculty, staff member, or non-affiliate directly to the Office of Community Standards & \\nIntegrity or via the following: \\n• Campus Security Authority (as defined in the university’s Annual Security and Fire Safety \\nReport); \\n• Carnegie Mellon University’s Ethics Reporting Hotline; \\n• Carnegie Mellon University’s Bias Reporting Resources; \\n• Carnegie Mellon University Police Department; \\n• City of Pittsburgh Police and/or other law enforcement agency; \\n• Information Security Office; or \\n• Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX. \\nThe Office of Community Standards & Integrity has the authority to review and adjudicate all \\nviolations of university standards, policies and regulations that involve students. The \\nuniversity community standards process may not be used for the adjudication of cases \\ninvolving the relationships or interactions between two parties that do not involve alleged \\nviolations of community standards. Additionally, a complaint may be resolved informally\",\n",

When reviewing a complaint, the Resolution Review Board will consider if the \\ndescribed behavior could violate a University policy or community standard if shown to be \\ntrue. The RRB may determine the described behavior does not constitute a violation of \\ncommunity standards or the complaint does not contain enough information to make such a \\ndetermination and may request additional information or further investigation. The RRB may \\ndismiss a complaint when it is determined there is no reasonable basis for resolution via the \\ncommunity standards process. Complaints that are dismissed may be resolved via an \\ninformal process including, but not limited to, conflict coaching, facilitating a dialogue, \\nmediation, restorative practices, or shuttle diplomacy. \\nStudent organizations, as members of the academic community, are expected to uphold \\nuniversity policies and community standards. Alleged violations of community standards \\nassociated with student organization activities may be reviewed through the community \\nstandards process. Individual students may be held accountable through the community \\nstandards process separate from any sanctions imposed on an organization found \\nresponsible for violating community standards. \\nWithdrawal of a Complaint \\nGenerally, when pending allegations are withdrawn by the complainant, the allegations \\nmay not be refiled unless new information becomes available that was not previously \\navailable. The refiled complaint will be reviewed by the Resolution Review Board to \\ndetermine if the allegations should move forward based on the current \\ncircumstances.  For allegations of sexual misconduct involving student respondents under \\nSection VI.E of the sexual misconduct policy (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct), this \\nwithdrawal of complaint rule applies only after the final investigative report is provided to \\nthe Office of Community Standards & Integrity for adjudication through the community \\nstandards process.   \\nEngagement Expectations \\nIt is an expectation that students involved in the community standards process make a \\ngood faith effort to participate and bring the matter to resolution. \\nIf a Complainant ceases to engage in the resolution process, the Resolution Review Board \\nmay elect to dismiss the allegations or the RRB may allow the allegations to proceed with',\n",

The Title IX Coordinator \\nwill play a key role in determining the existence of an overriding community interest in \\ncases involving alleged violations of the Carnegie Mellon Sexual Misconduct Policy \\n(Interim). \\nIn circumstances where an impacted party does not wish to pursue action through the \\ncommunity standards process and it is determined that an overriding community interest \\nexists, the University will bring the matter for review via the community standards \\nprocess. The impacted party will be informed of this decision as well as their options for \\nparticipation in the resolution process. \\nAdministrative Resolution Meeting \\nA student is expected to meet with a university adjudicator to attempt to resolve alleged \\nviolation(s) of university community standards. A successful administrative resolution \\nmeeting will include the following:  \\n1. \\nThe facts must be determined. The student must agree that essential facts related to the \\nincident are undisputed. \\n2. \\nA violation of community standards must be determined. The student must agree that \\nwhat occurred during the incident was a violation of the university's community \\nstandards. \\n3. \\nA proposed outcome or set of outcomes must be determined.

If agreement on the \\nappropriate action cannot be reached, the matter may be referred to the University \\nDisciplinary Committee for review. \\n \\nShould a student be non-responsive to notification of an alleged violation of the university's \\ncommunity standards, after a reasonable period of time and having made reasonable \\nattempts to contact the Respondent, the university adjudicator may make a determination \\nregarding responsibility and assign restorative outcomes and/or a period of disciplinary \\nprobation based on the information available. Consistent with Administrative Resolution \\nprocedures, this determination will be forwarded to the Resolution Review Board for \\napproval. Violations that may result in disciplinary suspension and where the student is non-\\nresponsive will be referred to the University Disciplinary Committee for resolution. \\nUniversity Disciplinary Committee \\nThe University Disciplinary Committee has jurisdiction in the following cases: \\n1. \\nAny cases of alleged violations of university standards and policies that the Resolution \\nReview Board deems sufficiently serious in nature or inappropriate for administrative \\nresolution. \\n2. \\nAny cases of alleged violations of university standards and policies in which one \\nstudent(s) is filing allegation against another student(s) that cannot be appropriately \\nresolved through the administrative resolution process. \\n3. \\nAppeals referred by the dean of students or designee to review summary actions \\nimposed by a university adjudicator or university staff member.  \\n4. \\nCases in which administrative resolution has not been successful. \\nWhen circumstances warrant, at the discretion of the Dean of Students or designee, a case \\nmay be reviewed by a Hearing Officer in lieu of the University Disciplinary Committee.

Notifications to the complainant/impacted party in \\ncases that involve a) crimes of violence and non-forcible sex offenses as defined by \\nthe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating \\nviolence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against \\nWomen Act (VAWA) will be made in writing by the process advisor and will include \\nnotification of the appeal process. \\n8. \\nAdministrative resolution meetings and University Disciplinary Committee hearings \\nwill be conducted by officials who receive annual training on the issues related to all \\nProhibited Conduct on how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that \\nprotects the safety of all involved while promoting accountability and a fair process. \\nCases Involving Student Organizations \\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to managing all cases that involve alleged \\nviolations of university policy by student organizations with appropriate care and \\nsensitivity. In these cases, the university may need to invoke additional procedural \\nprovisions to determine responsibility for alleged policy violation(s) by a student \\norganization. Recognized student organizations include groups that are given recognition \\nby a college, department or governing body on campus. Recognized student organizations \\nhave certain privileges and use of campus resources (e.g. funding (university or student',\n",
       " '287 \\n \\n \\nfees), use of designated spaces, participation in campus activities, ability to utilize \\nuniversity systems, etc).  \\nIn cases of alleged policy violations in which the responding party is a student \\norganization, the following procedures will supplement the procedures outlined in the \\nConduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings: \\n1. \\nIn cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may \\nviolate university policy and the impacted party chooses not to serve as a \\ncomplainant in a community standards proceeding, the university may act as a \\ncomplainant when there exists a broader or overriding community interest. \\nNotwithstanding the fact that the impacted party wishes not to serve as complainant, \\nthey may nevertheless act as a witness in a University Disciplinary Committee \\nhearing. \\n2. \\nIn cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may \\nviolate university policy, the university reserves the right to temporarily restrict any \\nand all activities and operations of the organization while the case is being \\ninvestigated and/or resolved through the appropriate process. \\n3. \\nFor purposes of organizational conduct, separation from the university may be \\ndefined as temporary or permanent loss of recognition along with associated \\nprivileges.  \\n4. \\nNo more than two student members may represent an organization in a community \\nstandards proceeding. \\n5. \\nThe University Disciplinary Committee may review both individual member and \\norganizational allegations concurrently. It is recommended that members \\nresponding to individual allegations do not also represent the organization in the \\nsame University Disciplinary Committee. \\n6. \\nA preponderance of the evidence standard (e.g., more likely than not) will be used to \\ndetermine if a university policy, standard, or regulation has been violated. \\n7. \\nAdministrative resolution meetings will be conducted by the SLICE representative or \\ndesignee for alleged violations of community standards by an organization. Should \\nadministrative resolution fail, the matter will be remanded to the Office of \\nCommunity Standards & Integrity for resolution. \\n8. \\nThe complaining party and each designated student representative is entitled to a \\ncopy of the board packet before the hearing.',\n",
       " '288 \\n \\n \\n9. \\nThe university is committed to resolving cases related to organizational conduct in a \\ntimely manner. Complainants and respondents will receive periodic status updates \\nrelated to the timeline for resolution of the case. \\n10. The university reserves the right to share periodic updates related to process, \\ntimeline, findings, and resolution of the case with appropriate parties including \\norganization advisors, the sponsoring academic unit, (inter)national organization \\nheadquarters, and/or recognizing body (e.g. Student Government or appropriate \\nGoverning Councils), etc. \\n11. Unless a different timeline is set forth in this section, stated timelines for a University \\nDisciplinary Committee hearing and notification of a decision will be followed in \\ncases involving student organizations. \\n12. Upon a finding of responsibility, the University Disciplinary Committee or \\nadjudicator will be provided with the student organization’s prior community \\nstandards violations (four years prior) for consideration when determining outcomes. \\nThe student organization representatives may be recalled before the board to \\ndiscuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the University Disciplinary \\nCommittee making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present \\ncase. The complainant may be recalled with the student organization \\nrepresentatives. \\n13. The University Disciplinary Committee may recommend as an outcome of the \\norganizational review, that an individual or individuals be charged with specific policy \\nviolations to be reviewed via a subsequent community standards process. \\n14. In cases that involve student organizations, complaints will be considered for a \\nperiod of four years following the date of the most recent allegation.  Complaints \\nreceived more than two years following the date of the most recent allegation may \\nbe reviewed upon the approval of the Associate Vice President for Community \\nStandards and Diversity Initiatives. \\n15. In cases that involve student organizations, the complainant will receive notification \\nof disposition of the allegation(s) to the degree that individual privacy is not \\nimpacted. \\n16. After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs \\nfor community life or designee will render a decision in writing. The decision letter \\nwill typically be delivered to the respondent(s) by the process advisor.',\n",
       " '289 \\n \\n \\n17. Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances \\nwarrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the \\nrespondent and complainant as necessary about the anticipated timeline. The \\ncomplainant and respondent will be notified in writing of the final decision. \\n18. Consistent with Pennsylvania state law, the university will issue and electronically \\npublish a biannual report of all reported hazing violations. Biannual hazing reports \\nare retained for at least five years. \\n19. Community standards records of student organizations are retained for a period of \\nseven years following the conclusion of the resolution process. The record may \\nbe maintained indefinitely if a student organization has not fulfilled all outcomes or \\nhas not resolved pending community standards allegations. Records of community \\nstandards processes that result in the temporary loss of recognition from the \\nuniversity will be maintained for a period of seven years after the organization \\nreceives recognition once the suspension period has concluded. Records of \\ncommunity standards processes that result in the permanent loss of recognition \\nfrom the university will be maintained indefinitely. \\nOutcomes \\nThe community standards outcomes defined below comprise a range of official action that \\nmay be imposed by the University for violations of community standards. One or more of \\nthese actions may be imposed in response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, \\nas other outcomes may be utilized as appropriate. \\nWhen outcomes are decided as part of the community standards process, the educational \\nand developmental needs of the involved student and the welfare of the community will be \\nconsidered with utmost importance. The outcomes categories (i.e. student status, restorative \\nand restrictive) are intended to clarify the role and purpose of the various actions. The \\ndetermination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of \\nthe community, the impact of the violation, documented community standards history, and \\nany mitigating or aggravating circumstances.  \\nNon-compliance with imposed or agreed-upon outcomes may result in further action \\nthrough the community standards process. Students with two (2) community standards \\nviolations within and academic year may immediately be placed in disciplinary probation. \\nStudent involved in three (3) violation within an academic year may be referred to the \\nUniversity Disciplinary Committee.',\n",
       " '290 \\n \\n \\nOutcomes Related to Student Standing \\nThese outcomes clarify the student’s standing with the University. Additional violations of \\ncommunity standards may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the \\nUniversity. \\n• Warning: For minor infractions, a student may be issued a written warning. The \\nwarning will be noted in the event of any further infractions of community standards \\nand may justify consideration of more severe outcomes. While a warning may \\ninfluence future actions related to student standing, a warning alone does not affect \\nstudent standing.  \\n• Residential Probation: An official notice to a residential student that conduct with \\nregard to university housing regulations or policies has been unacceptable and that \\nfuture violation of university regulations may result in more serious community \\nstandards action, including the possible loss of campus residency. Probation lasts for a \\nstated period of time. \\n• Disciplinary Probation: For a second infraction or for a single offense of a more serious \\nnature, a student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a designated period of \\ntime, during which subsequent community standards violations may result in \\nsuspension or expulsion.  A student on probation is still considered to be in good \\nstanding with the university. \\n• Disciplinary Suspension: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated \\nperiod of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves \\nfrom the campus (including but not limited to university housing, fraternity or sorority \\nhouses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and \\nto remain off the campus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the \\nPolicy on Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal. A student on disciplinary \\nsuspension is not eligible to register for courses, attend classes, live in university \\nhousing, use campus facilities, be on university property, participate in student \\nactivities, be an active member of a student organization, or be employed by the \\nuniversity during the period of suspension. \\n• Expulsion: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the \\nuniversity. Students who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from \\nuniversity property (including but not limited to university housing, fraternity or \\nsorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the',\n",
       " '291 \\n \\n \\naction and to remain off the campus permanently. Students who have been expelled \\nfrom the university may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the \\nuniversity. \\nRestorative Outcomes \\nThese outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior \\ncaused or to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the \\ncommunity.  Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in \\nadditional community standards action. \\n• Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations: The University may require a student \\nto meet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a \\nspecified time frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any \\nrelevant assessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent \\nrecommendation(s), such as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The \\nstudent is expected to provide the appropriate releases to allow the university to \\nconfirm compliance with this outcome. \\n• Community Service: The University may require uncompensated service (a specified \\nnumber of hours) to the university or an off-campus, non-profit organization as an \\noutcome. The particular assignment of duties must be pre- approved through the \\nappropriate university adjudicator. Students must provide appropriate documentation \\nverifying their completed community service. Failure to complete the service \\nsatisfactorily within the specified period of time may result in further action through \\nthe community standards process. \\n• Educational/Developmental Assignment: The University may require a student to \\ncomplete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student’s education and \\ndevelopment. These assignments are at the discretion of the university adjudicator or \\nUniversity Disciplinary Committee. Assignments may include but are not limited to: \\nreflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an \\nindividual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc. \\n• Restitution: In cases where a student is found responsible for damaging or \\nmisappropriating physical property, the student may be responsible for reimbursing \\nthe property owner for all or some of the cost. \\nIn limited circumstances when a complaint was filed prior to the respondent’s degree \\nconferral, the dean of students or designee may consider the following outcomes:',\n",
       " '292 \\n \\n \\n• Suspension of a conferred degree: A previously conferred degree is being suspended and \\nthe transcript will no longer reflect a completed degree. The degree will remain \\nsuspended until the time specified and any pending outcomes are completed. During the \\nduration of the degree suspension, the individual is prohibited from: representing that \\nthey have obtained a degree from Carnegie Mellon University; enrolling at Carnegie \\nMellon University; being present on University property; or participating in any Carnegie \\nMellon University sponsored events or activities, including alumni events. \\n• Revocation of a conferred degree: A previously conferred degree is being revoked and the \\ntranscript will no longer reflect a completed degree. The individual is prohibited from: \\nrepresenting that they have obtained a degree from Carnegie Mellon University; enrolling \\nat Carnegie Mellon University in the future; being present on University property; or \\nparticipating in any Carnegie Mellon University sponsored events or activities, including \\nalumni events.  \\nRestrictive Outcomes \\nThese outcomes prevent a student from engaging in certain activities, being present in \\ncertain spaces or engaging with individuals during a specific time period. Violation of a \\nrestriction may lead to additional community standards action. \\n• Loss of Privilege: Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to \\nfacilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university activities. \\n• Loss of Residency in University Housing: An action that excludes a student or student \\ngroup from residence in university housing for a stated period of time. A student who \\nloses residency in university housing shall be considered for future housing \\naccommodations once the period of debarment is concluded and as space permits. \\n• No Contact Order: A No Contact Order is a directive from an associate vice president of \\nstudent affairs or designee indicating that two students may not have direct contact \\nwith each other, or make indirect contact through third parties, except for that which is \\nnecessary for their academic pursuits. A No Contact Order may be issued in \\nconnection with the community standards process, either as an interim measure \\nduring the pendency of the process and/or an outcome associated with a finding of \\nresponsibility from the process. \\n• Room Reassignment: An action where a student is assigned to either another room in \\nthe same house community or a room in another house community. When a student \\nis assigned to another house community, specific restrictions concerning the previous \\ncommunity may be invoked.',\n",
       " \"293 \\n \\n \\nWithholding a Degree \\nBecause a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic \\nrequirements but also compliance with the university’s standards and good standing as a \\nmember of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a \\ndegree not be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the \\nresolution of community standards proceedings, including completion of all outcomes. \\nCitations \\nState citations are issued by University Police for violations of state law. While these \\ncitations are handled through the criminal justice system, students may also be expected to \\nmeet with a university adjudicator to determine whether a violation of community standards \\nhas also occurred. \\nWithdrawal with Pending Allegations \\nStudents who withdraw from the university with unresolved community standards \\nallegations should expect the university to adjudicate the matter to bring the case to \\nresolution and uphold the university’s obligation to expressly articulate eligibility to return to \\nthe university. If a good faith effort to participate in the appropriate process is not exhibited \\nby the respondent, the university may elect to resolve the matter through the community \\nstandards process without that student's participation. \\nReview After a Charge or Conviction of a Crime \\nIn circumstances that constitute a potential threat to the safety and security of the university \\ncommunity and/or to the university’s ability to function in whole or in part, the university may \\nreview a case when a student has been charged with or convicted of any felony or \\nmisdemeanor crime(s) in federal, state, or local court or an equivalent foreign court. The \\nreview will be conducted utilizing the university's community standards process and/or \\nSafety Intervention Protocol. \\nExamples of crimes that may trigger such review include but are not limited to: \\n• Aggravated assault \\n• Arson \\n• Burglary\",\n",
       " '294 \\n \\n \\n• Child abuse \\n• Criminal mischief \\n• Hazing \\n• Murder or manslaughter \\n• Rape \\n• Robbery \\n• Sexual assault \\n• Theft \\n• The manufacturing, selling or possessing with intent to sell any drug on the prescribed \\nlist subject to the criminal code of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \\nCommunity Standards Records Retention and Reporting \\nRecords of community standards proceedings are confidential and are not released without the \\nconsent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law or court \\norder. With the exceptions as noted below, records of community standards proceedings are \\nretained for either the period of time required under the federal Clery Act (which in most cases \\nis six to seven years after the date the incident was reported to the university), or three years \\nafter final separation of the student from the university, whichever is longer. For purposes of \\ndetermining final separation from the university, a student must be separated for three \\ncontinuous years. If a student re-enrolls in any student program within three years, the \\ncalculation of the final separation date will reset. \\nConsistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy, for purposes of community standards record \\nchecks, information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization as \\nnecessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as defined above) provided \\nthe student has fulfilled all obligations to the university. \\nThe file may be maintained indefinitely and reported longer than three years after the student \\nseparates from the university if a student has not fulfilled all obligations or has not resolved a \\npending Community Standards violation. \\nRecords of community standards proceedings resulting in the permanent separation of a \\nstudent from the university (e.g., expulsion) will be maintained and reported indefinitely.',\n",

(We discussed cosine, dot product, and euclidean similarity metrics).\n",

    "Answer: Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors rather than their magnitude. This makes it highly effective for text-based embeddings because the direction of the vector (which represents semantic meaning) is more important than the absolute value of the embedding. Unlike the dot product, cosine similarity does not depend on the magnitude of the embeddings. This is crucial for text-based search, where different words and sentences might have embeddings of varying lengths, but their semantic similarity should be preserved.\n",
