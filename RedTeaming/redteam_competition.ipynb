    "\n",
    "## FAQs:\n",
    "- **Why do I need to run the below lines of code?** *Because doing so will define the custom functions that you will need to execute in order to log your red teaming prompts and LLM responses to a database and then print this record off to submit via Canvas for the purpose of fulfilling your homework 3 requirements.*\n",
    "- **Why does running the below lines of code does not result in any output?** *These lines of code only work to define functions that you can execute (after defining them) to produce responses from LLMs and record your prompts and responses into a database and then print off this record to use for your homework submission.*\n",
    "- **Why are there so many lines of code but I use only two functions for completing the homework requirements** *Because you need to first define custom funtions in the environment that will then allow you to execute those two functions you need to complete your homework assignment.*\n",
    "- **Can I write my own custom functions to complete the homework assignment?** Yes. As long as your functions achieve the following: (i) log every prompt you submit to an LLM, (ii) log what LLM you submitted each prompt to, (iii) log each response from the LLM, (iv) log the date-time you submitted the prompts to an LLM; (v) records your evaluation of the LLM responses -- specificically: (a) whether the response is a violation OR a non-violation and (b) the severity of the violation, if the response was a violation.\n",
    "- **Isn't there a more beautiful way to code the below functions** Yes, probably! Our objective is to provide you usable vs. beautiful functions (e.g. code that runs repeatedly -- though as you've seen in prior assignments, our code is often not without bugs that we might have missed!). Sometimes we also write our functions in a more verbose manner to help you understand or see what the functions are doing. "

Start by layering lighter shades like sandy beige and light rust for the base layers, then add darker tones like deep red and black to create depth and shadows. Don't forget to blend and layer your colors to mimic the natural striations and curves of the canyon walls.\\n\\nTo capture the light beams that often filter through the top of the canyon, you can use a lighter, more translucent paint to create a glowing effect. Experiment with dry brushing or blending techniques to create a soft, ethereal look for the light beams.\\n\\nFeel free to add any personal touches or details to make the painting your own, whether it's adding tiny figures to show scale or incorporating your own color palette.
